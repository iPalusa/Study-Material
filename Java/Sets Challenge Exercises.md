5. **Set Size:**
   - Find the size of a set without using the `size()` method.

### Intermediate Level:

6. **Symmetric Difference:**
   - Implement a function to find the symmetric difference between two sets.

7. **Common Elements:**
   - Write a program to find common elements in two sets.

8. **Set Equality:**
   - Check if two sets are equal.

9. **Power Set:**
   - Generate the power set of a given set.

10. **Set Complement:**
    - Find the complement of a set with respect to another set.

16. **Set to List:**
    - Convert a set to a list without using built-in conversion methods.

17. **Set Rotation:**
    - Rotate the elements of a set to the right by a given number of positions.

18. **Set Operations with Iterators:**
    - Perform set operations using iterators rather than built-in methods.

19. **Set Cartesian Product:**
    - Calculate the Cartesian product of two sets.

20. **Set Intersection Size:**
    - Find the size of the intersection of multiple sets.

21. **Set Operations with Bitwise Manipulation:**
    - Implement set operations (union, intersection) using bitwise manipulation.

22. **Set Shuffle:**
    - Shuffle the elements of a set.

23. **Set Difference without Built-in Method:**
    - Implement the set difference operation without using built-in methods.
