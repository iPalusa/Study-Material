# **2. Thread Lifecycle**
## **States of a thread (New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, Terminated)**
Threads go through various states during their lifecycle. Here's a simple explanation of the different states a thread can be in:

1. **New:**
   - This is the starting point. The thread is created, but it hasn't started running yet.

2. **Runnable:**
   - The thread is ready to run, and the system can choose to run it. However, it might be waiting for its turn to get the processor's attention.

3. **Blocked:**
   - The thread is prevented from entering the runnable state. It might be waiting for a resource that is currently being used by another thread.

4. **Waiting:**
   - The thread is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action. It remains in this state until it gets a notification that the action is complete.

5. **Timed Waiting:**
   - Similar to the waiting state, but with a time limit. The thread will wait for a specified amount of time before moving to another state.

6. **Terminated:**
   - The thread has finished its execution. It could reach this state either because it has completed its task or due to an exception.

In simpler terms, imagine a thread as a person doing a task. They start as "New," then become "Runnable" when they are ready to work. If they need something that's currently being used by someone else, they become "Blocked." If they are waiting for a specific action from another person, they are in the "Waiting" state. "Timed Waiting" is similar, but with a deadline. Finally, when they finish their job, they are "Terminated."

## **Thread creation and execution**

Thread creation and execution involve the process of creating a new thread and managing its lifecycle. Here's a simplified explanation:

### **Thread Creation:**
   - **Creating a Thread:**
     - In Java, you can create a thread by either extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.
     - Extending Thread:
       ```java
       class MyThread extends Thread {
           public void run() {
               // Code to be executed in the new thread
           }
       }
       ```
     - Implementing Runnable:
       ```java
       class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
           public void run() {
               // Code to be executed in the new thread
           }
       }
       ```
   - **Instantiating and Starting a Thread:**
     - Once you've defined your thread, you create an instance and start it using the `start()` method.
       ```java
       // Using Thread class
       MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
       myThread.start();

       // Using Runnable interface
       Thread myRunnableThread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
       myRunnableThread.start();
       ```

### **Thread Execution:**
   - **Run Method:**
     - The actual work that a thread performs is defined in the `run()` method of the `Thread` class or the `Runnable` interface.
       ```java
       class MyThread extends Thread {
           public void run() {
               // Code to be executed in the new thread
           }
       }

       class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
           public void run() {
               // Code to be executed in the new thread
           }
       }
       ```
   - **Thread Lifecycle:**
     - Once started, the thread goes through different states in its lifecycle (New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, Terminated).
     - The thread scheduler of the operating system determines when to execute the thread.

   - **Example:**
     ```java
     public class ThreadExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
             myThread.start(); // This will invoke the run method in a new thread

             // Or using Runnable
             Thread myRunnableThread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
             myRunnableThread.start();
         }
     }
     ```
