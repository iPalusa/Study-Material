### Thread Synchronization and Coordination:

1. Implement a producer-consumer problem with multiple producers and consumers using `wait()` and `notify()` methods.
2. Create a deadlock scenario involving multiple threads and demonstrate how to avoid it using proper synchronization.
3. Implement a thread-safe singleton class using double-checked locking.
4. Solve the dining philosophers problem, ensuring that each philosopher avoids deadlock and starvation.
5. Create a program with multiple readers and writers accessing a shared resource using the "readers-writers" problem approach.

### Advanced Thread Communication:

6. Implement a custom `CyclicBarrier` class that allows multiple threads to synchronize at a predefined barrier point.
7. Design a custom `Semaphore` class to control access to a shared resource with a limited number of permits.
8. Implement a `CountDownLatch` mechanism for waiting until a fixed number of threads complete their tasks.
9. Create a program that uses `Exchanger` to exchange data between two threads at a synchronization point.
10. Implement a custom `Phaser` for synchronizing multiple threads in a phased manner.

### Thread Pools and Executors:

11. Create a fixed-size thread pool using `ExecutorService` to process a set of tasks concurrently.
12. Design a program that uses a `ScheduledExecutorService` to schedule tasks to run at specified intervals.
13. Implement a custom thread factory for creating threads with specific attributes in a thread pool.
14. Create a program that uses a `CompletionService` to asynchronously process multiple tasks and retrieve results.
15. Implement a custom `RejectedExecutionHandler` for handling rejected tasks in a thread pool.

### Thread Safety and Immutability:

16. Design an immutable class with proper thread safety guarantees.
17. Implement a thread-safe cache using `ConcurrentHashMap` for efficient read and write operations.
18. Create a program demonstrating the "publication and escape" problem and fix it using proper synchronization.
19. Design a thread-safe lazy initialization mechanism using the "double-check idiom."
20. Implement a program using the `ThreadLocal` class to store thread-specific data.

### Thread Coordination with Java Concurrency Utilities:

21. Develop a program using `Semaphore` to control access to a shared resource among multiple threads.
22. Design a concurrent program using `CountDownLatch` to coordinate the execution of multiple tasks.
23. Implement a program using the `CyclicBarrier` class for concurrent execution with synchronization points.
24. Create a concurrent program using the `Phaser` class for multiple threads to synchronize in phases.
25. Design a multi-stage concurrent processing pipeline using `ExecutorService` and `BlockingQueue`.
