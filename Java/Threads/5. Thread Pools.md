# **5. Thread Pools:**
## Executor framework
The Executor framework in Java provides a higher-level replacement for managing and controlling threads. It abstracts the complexity of thread creation, management, and execution, making it easier to develop concurrent programs. The primary interface for the Executor framework is the `Executor` interface, and its most common implementation is the `ExecutorService` interface.

**Key Components of the Executor Framework:**

1. **Executor Interface:**
   - The core interface that represents an object capable of executing submitted `Runnable` tasks.

   ```java
   public interface Executor {
       void execute(Runnable command);
   }
   ```

2. **ExecutorService Interface:**
   - Extends the `Executor` interface and provides additional methods for managing the lifecycle of the executor and controlling the execution of tasks.

   ```java
   public interface ExecutorService extends Executor {
       void shutdown();
       List<Runnable> shutdownNow();
       // Other methods for task submission, future retrieval, etc.
   }
   ```

3. **ThreadPoolExecutor Class:**
   - A powerful and flexible implementation of the `ExecutorService` interface. It provides a pool of worker threads that can execute submitted tasks.

   ```java
   public class ThreadPoolExecutor extends AbstractExecutorService {
       // Constructors and various configuration options
   }
   ```

### **Basic Usage of the Executor Framework:**

1. **Creating an ExecutorService:**
   - Use the `Executors` utility class to create instances of `ExecutorService`.

   ```java
   ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
   ```

   This creates a fixed-size thread pool with 5 worker threads.

2. **Submitting Tasks:**
   - Submit `Runnable` or `Callable` tasks to the `ExecutorService`.

   ```java
   executorService.execute(() -> {
       // Your task logic here
   });

   Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(() -> {
       // Your task logic here
       return 42;
   });
   ```

3. **Shutting Down the ExecutorService:**
   - Properly shut down the `ExecutorService` when it's no longer needed.

   ```java
   executorService.shutdown();
   ```

   This initiates an orderly shutdown, allowing previously submitted tasks to execute before terminating the executor.

**Example: Using ExecutorService to Perform Concurrent Tasks:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ExecutorServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a fixed-size thread pool with 3 worker threads
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submitting tasks to the executor service
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            final int taskNumber = i;
            executorService.execute(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskNumber + " is running on thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        // Shutting down the executor service
        executorService.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this example, a fixed-size thread pool with three worker threads is created using `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3)`. Five tasks are then submitted for execution. The executor service handles the task execution, and once all tasks are completed, the executor service is shut down. The number of worker threads in the pool is configurable based on the requirements of the application.

## ThreadPoolExecutor
`ThreadPoolExecutor` is a powerful and flexible implementation of the `ExecutorService` interface in Java. It provides a pool of worker threads that can execute submitted tasks concurrently. It allows developers to configure various aspects of the thread pool, such as the core pool size, maximum pool size, thread keep-alive time, and the work queue used to hold tasks awaiting execution.

### **Key Features of ThreadPoolExecutor:**

1. **Core Pool Size:**
   - The number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they are idle. Threads in the core pool are created when the pool is created and can grow up to the specified core pool size.

2. **Maximum Pool Size:**
   - The maximum number of threads allowed in the pool. If there are more tasks than threads in the core pool, and the work queue is not full, new threads will be created up to the maximum pool size.

3. **Keep-Alive Time:**
   - The maximum time that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating.

4. **Work Queue:**
   - A blocking queue that holds tasks waiting to be executed. Tasks are pulled from the queue and executed by worker threads.

5. **Thread Factory:**
   - A factory for creating new threads. It allows customization of thread properties.

6. **Rejected Execution Handler:**
   - A handler that decides what to do when a task cannot be accepted by the executor.

### **Constructor of ThreadPoolExecutor:**

```java
public ThreadPoolExecutor(
    int corePoolSize,
    int maximumPoolSize,
    long keepAliveTime,
    TimeUnit unit,
    BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue,
    ThreadFactory threadFactory,
    RejectedExecutionHandler handler
);
```

**Example Usage of ThreadPoolExecutor:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class CustomThreadPoolExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a ThreadPoolExecutor with custom configurations
        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
                2,          // Core pool size
                5,          // Maximum pool size
                10,         // Keep-alive time for excess idle threads
                TimeUnit.SECONDS,
                new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(10),  // Work queue
                Executors.defaultThreadFactory(), // Thread factory
                new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy() // Rejected execution handler
        );

        // Submit tasks to the executor
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            final int taskNumber = i;
            executor.execute(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskNumber + " is running on thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        // Shutdown the executor when it's no longer needed
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this example, a `ThreadPoolExecutor` is created with a core pool size of 2, a maximum pool size of 5, a keep-alive time of 10 seconds for excess idle threads, a work queue of size 10, the default thread factory, and an `AbortPolicy` as the rejected execution handler. Tasks are then submitted to the executor for execution. It's important to shut down the executor using `executor.shutdown()` when it's no longer needed to release resources.

## ScheduledExecutorService
`ScheduledExecutorService` is an extension of the `ExecutorService` interface in Java that provides a convenient way to schedule the execution of tasks at fixed rates or delays. It allows developers to execute tasks periodically or with a delay, making it suitable for scenarios such as recurring tasks, periodic cleanup, or other time-based operations.

### **Key Features of `ScheduledExecutorService`:**

1. **Schedule at Fixed Rate:**
   - Schedule a task to be executed periodically at a fixed rate, regardless of how long the task takes to complete.

2. **Schedule with Fixed Delay:**
   - Schedule a task to be executed with a fixed delay between the termination of one execution and the commencement of the next.

3. **Schedule with Initial Delay:**
   - Optionally specify an initial delay before the first execution of the task.

4. **Support for `Runnable` and `Callable` Tasks:**
   - Like the `ExecutorService`, `ScheduledExecutorService` can execute both `Runnable` and `Callable` tasks.

5. **Cancellation and Shutdown:**
   - The scheduled tasks can be canceled individually, and the entire `ScheduledExecutorService` can be shut down when it's no longer needed.

### **Creating a `ScheduledExecutorService`:**

```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
```

This creates a `ScheduledExecutorService` with a pool of two threads.

### **Scheduling Tasks:**

```java
// Schedule a task to run periodically at a fixed rate
ScheduledFuture<?> future1 = scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(
    () -> System.out.println("Task 1: Executing at fixed rate"),
    1,     // Initial delay (in seconds)
    3,     // Period (in seconds)
    TimeUnit.SECONDS
);

// Schedule a task with a fixed delay
ScheduledFuture<?> future2 = scheduler.scheduleWithFixedDelay(
    () -> System.out.println("Task 2: Executing with fixed delay"),
    1,     // Initial delay (in seconds)
    3,     // Delay between termination and next execution (in seconds)
    TimeUnit.SECONDS
);
```

In this example, `scheduleAtFixedRate` schedules a task to run periodically at a fixed rate of 3 seconds, and `scheduleWithFixedDelay` schedules a task with an initial delay of 1 second and a fixed delay of 3 seconds between the termination of one execution and the commencement of the next.

### **Cancelling Tasks:**

```java
// Cancel a scheduled task
future1.cancel(true);

// Shutdown the scheduler when it's no longer needed
scheduler.shutdown();
```

Individual tasks can be canceled using the `cancel` method of the `ScheduledFuture`. The entire `ScheduledExecutorService` should be shut down using the `shutdown` method when it's no longer needed.

**Example Usage:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class ScheduledExecutorServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);

        // Schedule a task to run periodically at a fixed rate
        ScheduledFuture<?> future1 = scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(
            () -> System.out.println("Task 1: Executing at fixed rate"),
            1,     // Initial delay (in seconds)
            3,     // Period (in seconds)
            TimeUnit.SECONDS
        );

        // Schedule a task with a fixed delay
        ScheduledFuture<?> future2 = scheduler.scheduleWithFixedDelay(
            () -> System.out.println("Task 2: Executing with fixed delay"),
            1,     // Initial delay (in seconds)
            3,     // Delay between termination and next execution (in seconds)
            TimeUnit.SECONDS
        );

        // Allow time for tasks to execute
        try {
            Thread.sleep(15_000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Cancel a scheduled task
        future1.cancel(true);

        // Shutdown the scheduler when it's no longer needed
        scheduler.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this example, two tasks are scheduled to run periodically with different scheduling methods. The main thread then sleeps for a duration to allow the scheduled tasks to execute. Finally, one of the tasks is canceled, and the scheduler is shut down.
