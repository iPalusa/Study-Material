Handling thread interruption in Java is a mechanism used to gracefully stop or interrupt a running thread. Interruption is a way to signal a thread that it should stop its execution and possibly clean up resources. In Java, this is achieved through the use of the `interrupt()` method, the `isInterrupted()` method, and handling `InterruptedException`.

### Handling Thread Interruption:

1. **`interrupt()` Method:**
   - The `Thread` class in Java provides an `interrupt()` method.
   - Calling `interrupt()` on a thread sets its interrupt status to true.
   - If the thread is blocked in certain methods (e.g., `Object.wait()`, `Thread.sleep()`, or `Object.wait()`), it will throw an `InterruptedException` to indicate that it has been interrupted.

2. **`isInterrupted()` Method:**
   - The `Thread` class also provides the `isInterrupted()` method.
   - It can be used to check the interrupt status of a thread without clearing its interrupt status.

### InterruptedException:

- `InterruptedException` is a checked exception that is thrown when a thread is waiting, sleeping, or otherwise occupied, and another thread interrupts it using the `interrupt()` method.
- It is commonly associated with methods like `Thread.sleep()`, `Object.wait()`, and `Thread.join()` that can throw this exception when the thread is interrupted.
- Handling `InterruptedException` is important to ensure that the thread can gracefully respond to being interrupted.

### Example of Handling Thread Interruption:

```java
public class InterruptExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread myThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
                    // Perform some task
                    System.out.println("Thread is running...");

                    // Simulate some work
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // Handle the InterruptedException
                System.out.println("Thread has been interrupted.");
            }
        });

        myThread.start();

        // Let the thread run for a while
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Interrupt the thread
        myThread.interrupt();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `myThread` performs some task in a loop until it is interrupted.
- The main thread lets `myThread` run for 5 seconds and then interrupts it using `myThread.interrupt()`.
- The `InterruptedException` is caught inside the `try-catch` block, allowing the thread to clean up and gracefully exit.
