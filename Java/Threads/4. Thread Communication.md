# **4. Thread Communication**
## **Inter-thread Communication using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() in the Producer-Consumer Problem:**

Inter-thread communication is crucial in scenarios where multiple threads need to coordinate and synchronize their activities. The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic example of such a scenario, where one or more threads act as producers generating data, and one or more threads act as consumers consuming that data.

In Java, the `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods, along with the intrinsic lock of an object, can be used for inter-thread communication.

### **Inter-thread Communication Basics:**

- **Object Intrinsic Lock:**
  - Every object in Java has an associated intrinsic lock. The `synchronized` keyword is used to acquire and release this lock.

- **wait():**
  - The `wait()` method is used by a thread to voluntarily release the lock and wait for another thread to notify it. It is called within a synchronized block.

- **notify():**
  - The `notify()` method is used to wake up one of the threads that are currently waiting on the object. It is also called within a synchronized block.

- **notifyAll():**
  - The `notifyAll()` method wakes up all the threads that are currently waiting on the object.

### **Producer-Consumer Problem:**

The Producer-Consumer problem involves two types of threads:

- **Producers:**
  - Produce data or resources.

- **Consumers:**
  - Consume the produced data or resources.

Both producers and consumers share a common, finite-sized buffer to store the produced items.

**Example Implementation:**
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class SharedResource {
    private final Queue<Integer> buffer = new LinkedList<>();
    private final int BUFFER_SIZE = 5;

    public synchronized void produce() {
        while (buffer.size() == BUFFER_SIZE) {
            try {
                wait(); // Wait if the buffer is full
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        // Produce an item and add it to the buffer
        int newItem = (int) (Math.random() * 100);
        buffer.add(newItem);
        System.out.println("Produced: " + newItem);

        notifyAll(); // Notify waiting consumers
    }

    public synchronized void consume() {
        while (buffer.isEmpty()) {
            try {
                wait(); // Wait if the buffer is empty
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        // Consume an item from the buffer
        int consumedItem = buffer.poll();
        System.out.println("Consumed: " + consumedItem);

        notifyAll(); // Notify waiting producers
    }
}

class Producer implements Runnable {
    private final SharedResource sharedResource;

    public Producer(SharedResource sharedResource) {
        this.sharedResource = sharedResource;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            sharedResource.produce();
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate some production time
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

class Consumer implements Runnable {
    private final SharedResource sharedResource;

    public Consumer(SharedResource sharedResource) {
        this.sharedResource = sharedResource;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            sharedResource.consume();
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1500); // Simulate some consumption time
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource sharedResource = new SharedResource();

        // Creating producer and consumer threads
        Thread producerThread = new Thread(new Producer(sharedResource));
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(new Consumer(sharedResource));

        // Starting the threads
        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `SharedResource` class represents the shared buffer and contains methods for producing and consuming items.
- The `produce()` and `consume()` methods use `wait()` to wait for the buffer to be non-full or non-empty, respectively.
- The `notifyAll()` method is used to notify waiting threads when an item is produced or consumed, allowing them to proceed.
- The `Producer` and `Consumer` classes implement the `Runnable` interface and contain the logic for producing and consuming items, respectively.
- The `Main` class creates instances of the `SharedResource`, `Producer`, and `Consumer` classes and starts the producer and consumer threads.

In this example, the producer and consumer threads coordinate through the `SharedResource` object, and inter-thread communication is achieved using `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods to ensure that producers and consumers operate on the shared buffer in a synchronized manner.
