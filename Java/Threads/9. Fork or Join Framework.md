# **9. Fork/Join Framework**

## **RecursiveTask and RecursiveAction**
`RecursiveTask` and `RecursiveAction` are classes in the `java.util.concurrent` package that are part of the Fork/Join Framework introduced in Java 7. They are designed to simplify the implementation of recursive parallel algorithms by providing a convenient way to express computations that can be divided into smaller tasks.

### `RecursiveTask`

- **Computational Task with Result:**
  - `RecursiveTask<T>` is a subclass of `ForkJoinTask<T>` where `T` is the result type of the computation.
  
- **Key Features:**
  - Represents a task that returns a result.
  - Used in situations where the computation involves dividing the task into smaller subtasks, computing their results, and combining those results to produce the final result.
  - It typically involves recursive decomposition of the problem.

- **Example Usage:**
  ```java
  import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;

  public class MyRecursiveTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
      private final int threshold;
      private final int[] array;

      public MyRecursiveTask(int[] array, int threshold) {
          this.array = array;
          this.threshold = threshold;
      }

      @Override
      protected Integer compute() {
          if (array.length <= threshold) {
              // Perform the computation directly for small tasks
              return computeDirectly();
          } else {
              // Split the task into subtasks
              MyRecursiveTask leftTask = new MyRecursiveTask(Arrays.copyOfRange(array, 0, array.length / 2), threshold);
              MyRecursiveTask rightTask = new MyRecursiveTask(Arrays.copyOfRange(array, array.length / 2, array.length), threshold);

              // Fork the subtasks in parallel
              leftTask.fork();
              rightTask.fork();

              // Join the results of the subtasks
              return leftTask.join() + rightTask.join();
          }
      }

      private Integer computeDirectly() {
          // Perform the computation for small tasks
          // (e.g., summing elements in the array)
          // and return the result
      }
  }
  ```

### `RecursiveAction`:

- **Computational Task without Result:**
  - `RecursiveAction` is similar to `RecursiveTask`, but it does not return a result. It is a subclass of `ForkJoinTask<Void>`.

- **Key Features:**
  - Represents a task that does not return a result.
  - Suitable for scenarios where the computation involves dividing the task into smaller subtasks, computing their results, and the results are not combined or aggregated.
  - It typically involves recursive decomposition of the problem.

- **Example Usage:**
  ```java
  import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction;

  public class MyRecursiveAction extends RecursiveAction {
      private final int threshold;
      private final int[] array;

      public MyRecursiveAction(int[] array, int threshold) {
          this.array = array;
          this.threshold = threshold;
      }

      @Override
      protected void compute() {
          if (array.length <= threshold) {
              // Perform the computation directly for small tasks
              computeDirectly();
          } else {
              // Split the task into subtasks
              MyRecursiveAction leftTask = new MyRecursiveAction(Arrays.copyOfRange(array, 0, array.length / 2), threshold);
              MyRecursiveAction rightTask = new MyRecursiveAction(Arrays.copyOfRange(array, array.length / 2, array.length), threshold);

              // Fork the subtasks in parallel
              leftTask.fork();
              rightTask.fork();

              // Join the results of the subtasks (not applicable for RecursiveAction)
          }
      }

      private void computeDirectly() {
          // Perform the computation for small tasks
          // (e.g., modifying elements in the array)
      }
  }
  ```

### Common Considerations:

- **Use Case:**
  - Use `RecursiveTask` when the computation produces a result that needs to be aggregated or combined.
  - Use `RecursiveAction` when the computation does not produce a result or when the results of subtasks are not combined.

- **Recursive Decomposition:**
  - Both classes are designed for recursive decomposition of problems into smaller subproblems.

- **Fork/Join Framework:**
  - These classes are meant to be used in conjunction with the Fork/Join Framework, which provides a pool of worker threads to execute the tasks in parallel.

- **Threshold:**
  - The `threshold` parameter is often used to determine when to stop dividing the task into smaller subtasks and perform the computation directly.

## **Work-stealing algorithm**

The work-stealing algorithm is a scheduling algorithm used in parallel computing environments, particularly in the context of the Fork/Join Framework. It is designed to efficiently distribute tasks among a pool of worker threads in order to achieve load balancing and maximize parallelism.

In the context of Java, the Fork/Join Framework employs the work-stealing algorithm to manage and execute tasks in a parallel and efficient manner. Here's an overview of how the work-stealing algorithm works:

### Key Concepts:

1. **Task Decomposition:**
   - Initially, a large task is decomposed into smaller subtasks. Each subtask represents a unit of work that can be executed independently.

2. **Task Distribution:**
   - A pool of worker threads is created to handle the execution of tasks. Threads in the pool are organized in a deque (double-ended queue).

3. **Deque Structure:**
   - Each worker thread has its own deque, which is a queue where tasks can be stolen or pushed.

4. **Stealing Mechanism:**
   - When a worker thread finishes its assigned tasks, it can steal tasks from the back (bottom) of the deque of another idle worker thread.

5. **Load Balancing:**
   - The stealing mechanism helps achieve load balancing by redistributing tasks among worker threads. Threads with more work can help out threads with less work.

6. **Termination Conditions:**
   - The work-stealing algorithm continues until all tasks are completed. Threads continue to execute tasks and steal work until the deque is empty.

### Example Scenario:

Let's consider a simple scenario with three worker threads (T1, T2, T3) and a pool of tasks to be executed:

1. Initially, a large task is decomposed into subtasks and distributed among the worker threads.

   ```
   T1: [Task A, Task B, Task C]
   T2: [Task D, Task E, Task F]
   T3: [Task G, Task H, Task I]
   ```

2. As threads complete their tasks, they may steal tasks from the back of the deque of another thread.

   - If T2 finishes its tasks first, it may steal a task from the deque of T3:

     ```
     T1: [Task A, Task B, Task C]
     T2: [Task D, Task E, Task F, Stolen Task I]
     T3: [Task G, Task H]
     ```

   - This stealing process continues until all tasks are completed.

### Benefits:

- **Load Balancing:**
  - The work-stealing algorithm naturally adapts to imbalances in workload, ensuring that idle threads can help out busy threads.

- **Parallelism:**
  - Multiple threads can work on tasks concurrently, maximizing parallelism and utilizing available CPU cores efficiently.

- **Scalability:**
  - The algorithm scales well with an increasing number of available threads, making it suitable for parallel computing on multicore systems.

## Java Fork/Join Framework:

In Java, the Fork/Join Framework utilizes the work-stealing algorithm. The `ForkJoinPool` manages a pool of worker threads, each with its own deque. The framework is commonly used with `RecursiveTask` and `RecursiveAction` classes to express parallel computations.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;

public class MyRecursiveTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    // Implementation of RecursiveTask
    // ...
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ForkJoinPool forkJoinPool = new ForkJoinPool();
        MyRecursiveTask myTask = new MyRecursiveTask(/* initial parameters */);

        int result = forkJoinPool.invoke(myTask); // Initiates the computation
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

In this example, the Fork/Join Framework automatically handles the work-stealing among worker threads, distributing the tasks efficiently and providing parallel execution. The `invoke` method initiates the computation and returns the result.
