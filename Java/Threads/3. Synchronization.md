# **3. Synchronization**

## Critical sections and race conditions

### **Critical Sections:**
   - A critical section is a part of a program where shared resources are accessed or modified, and the order of execution needs to be controlled to maintain data consistency.

   - **Example:**
     ```java
     class Counter {
         private int count = 0;

         // Critical Section
         public void increment() {
             synchronized (this) {
                 count++;
             }
         }
     }
     ```
     In this example, the `increment` method is a critical section because it modifies the shared resource (`count`). The `synchronized` keyword is used to ensure that only one thread can execute this method at a time. Without synchronization, if two or more threads try to increment `count` simultaneously, they might read the current value, both add 1 to it, and then write it back. This could result in the `count` being incremented by less than the actual number of increment operations.

### **Race Conditions:**
   - A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the order of execution.

   - **Example:**
     ```java
     class SharedResource {
         private int value = 0;

         public void increment() {
             value++;
         }

         public int getValue() {
             return value;
         }
     }
     ```
     ```java
     class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             SharedResource sharedResource = new SharedResource();

             // Thread 1
             new Thread(() -> {
                 for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                     sharedResource.increment();
                 }
             }).start();

             // Thread 2
             new Thread(() -> {
                 for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                     sharedResource.increment();
                 }
             }).start();

             // Main thread
             try {
                 Thread.sleep(1000); // Wait for threads to finish
             } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                 e.printStackTrace();
             }

             System.out.println("Final Value: " + sharedResource.getValue());
         }
     }
     ```
     In this example, both threads increment the `value` of the shared resource. However, due to the lack of synchronization, a race condition occurs, and the final value may not be as expected. The output is unpredictable and varies each time the program runs.

### **Preventing Race Conditions:**
   - Use synchronization mechanisms such as the `synchronized` keyword, locks, or atomic operations to ensure that only one thread can access the critical section at a time.

   - **Example (with synchronization):**
     ```java
     class SharedResource {
         private int value = 0;

         public synchronized void increment() {
             value++;
         }

         public int getValue() {
             return value;
         }
     }
     ```
     Now, the `increment` method is synchronized, preventing race conditions and ensuring the correctness of the shared resource's state.

## **Synchronized methods and blocks**

In Java, synchronization is used to control access to shared resources to avoid race conditions and maintain data consistency in multithreaded environments. Two common ways to achieve synchronization are through synchronized methods and synchronized blocks.

### **Synchronized Methods:**
   - When a method is declared as synchronized, it ensures that only one thread can execute that method at a time for a particular instance of the class.

   - **Example:**
     ```java
     class Counter {
         private int count = 0;

         // Synchronized method
         public synchronized void increment() {
             count++;
         }

         public int getCount() {
             return count;
         }
     }
     ```
     In this example, the `increment` method is synchronized, and only one thread can execute it at a time for a given `Counter` instance.

### **Synchronized Blocks:**
   - Synchronized blocks allow more fine-grained control over which part of the code should be synchronized. It involves specifying an object as a monitor, and only one thread can hold that monitor at a time.

   - **Example:**
     ```java
     class Counter {
         private int count = 0;
         private Object lock = new Object();

         public void increment() {
             synchronized (lock) { // Synchronized block
                 count++;
             }
         }

         public int getCount() {
             return count;
         }
     }
     ```
     In this example, the `increment` method uses a synchronized block with the `lock` object as a monitor. This allows more flexibility in controlling synchronization, and multiple methods can be synchronized independently. When a thread wants to execute the `increment()` method, it needs to acquire the lock associated with the `lock` object. If another thread holds the lock, the second thread will be blocked and will wait until the lock becomes available. Any object in Java can be used as a lock. In this case, a separate `lock` object is created solely for synchronization purposes. It's a common practice to use a dedicated object for synchronization to avoid potential issues with using intrinsic locks on the instance itself.

### **Choosing Between Synchronized Methods and Blocks:**
   - **Synchronized Methods:**
     - Convenient for synchronizing entire methods.
     - Simpler syntax.
     - Can be less flexible if you need to synchronize only part of the method.

   - **Synchronized Blocks:**
     - More granular control over synchronization.
     - Allows synchronization on different objects, providing flexibility.
     - Useful when you want to synchronize only a specific section of a method.

**Caution:**
   - While synchronization prevents race conditions, it can also introduce performance overhead. It's essential to use it judiciously to avoid unnecessary contention and ensure a balance between thread safety and performance.

## **Locks and their usage**
In Java, locks provide a more flexible and fine-grained mechanism for controlling access to shared resources in multithreaded environments. The `java.util.concurrent.locks` package provides several lock implementations that offer advanced features beyond the basic synchronization provided by the `synchronized` keyword. Here, we'll explore the usage of locks:

### **ReentrantLock:**
   - The `ReentrantLock` is a commonly used lock implementation. It allows a thread to re-enter a critical section that it already holds, providing a higher degree of flexibility than traditional synchronization.

   - **Example:**
     ```java
     import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

     class Counter {
         private int count = 0;
         private ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

         public void increment() {
             lock.lock(); // Acquiring the lock
             try {
                 count++;
             } finally {
                 lock.unlock(); // Releasing the lock in a finally block to ensure it's always released
             }
         }

         public int getCount() {
             return count;
         }
     }
     ```

#### **Methods:**

1. **`lock()` Method:**
   - Acquires the lock. If the lock is not available, the calling thread will be blocked until it can acquire the lock.

   ```java
   ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
   lock.lock();
   try {
       // Critical section
   } finally {
       lock.unlock();
   }
   ```

2. **`tryLock()` Method:**
   - Attempts to acquire the lock without waiting. Returns `true` if the lock was acquired and `false` otherwise.

   ```java
   if (lock.tryLock()) {
       try {
           // Critical section
       } finally {
           lock.unlock();
       }
   } else {
       // Handle the case where the lock couldn't be acquired immediately
   }
   ```

3. **`tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` Method:**
   - Attempts to acquire the lock within the specified time. Returns `true` if the lock was acquired and `false` if the specified waiting time elapses.

   ```java
   if (lock.tryLock(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
       try {
           // Critical section
       } finally {
           lock.unlock();
       }
   } else {
       // Handle the case where the lock couldn't be acquired within the specified time
   }
   ```

4. **`lockInterruptibly()` Method:**
   - Acquires the lock, but the operation is interruptible. If the thread is interrupted while waiting to acquire the lock, it can choose to respond accordingly.

   ```java
   try {
       lock.lockInterruptibly();
       // Critical section
   } catch (InterruptedException e) {
       // Handle the interruption
   } finally {
       lock.unlock();
   }
   ```

5. **`unlock()` Method:**
   - Releases the lock. It must be called in a `finally` block to ensure that the lock is released, even if an exception occurs within the critical section.

   ```java
   lock.lock();
   try {
       // Critical section
   } finally {
       lock.unlock();
   }
   ```

6. **`isHeldByCurrentThread()` Method:**
   - Returns `true` if the current thread holds the lock and `false` otherwise.

   ```java
   if (lock.isHeldByCurrentThread()) {
       // The current thread holds the lock
   } else {
       // The current thread does not hold the lock
   }
   ```

7. **`getHoldCount()` Method:**
   - Returns the number of times the current thread has acquired the lock. This count includes reentrant acquisitions.

   ```java
   int holdCount = lock.getHoldCount();
   ```

8. **`isLocked()` Method:**
   - Returns `true` if the lock is currently held by any thread and `false` otherwise.

   ```java
   if (lock.isLocked()) {
       // The lock is currently held by some thread
   } else {
       // The lock is not held by any thread
   }
   ```


### **Lock Interface:**
   - The `Lock` interface provides a common protocol for different lock implementations. Besides `ReentrantLock`, there are other implementations like `ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock` and `ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock`.

   - **Example:**
     ```java
     import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
     import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

     class Counter {
         private int count = 0;
         private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

         public void increment() {
             lock.lock(); // Acquiring the lock
             try {
                 count++;
             } finally {
                 lock.unlock(); // Releasing the lock
             }
         }

         public int getCount() {
             return count;
         }
     }
     ```

### **Locks with Conditions:**
   - Locks provide support for conditions, allowing threads to wait for a specific condition to be satisfied before proceeding.

   - **Example:**
     ```java
     import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
     import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
     import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

     class BoundedBuffer {
         private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
         private final Condition notFull = lock.newCondition();
         private final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();

         public void put(int value) throws InterruptedException {
             lock.lock();
             try {
                 // Critical section
                 while (isFull()) {
                     notFull.await(); // Wait until not full
                 }
                 // Perform the put operation
                 // ...
                 notEmpty.signal(); // Signal not empty
             } finally {
                 lock.unlock();
             }
         }

         public int take() throws InterruptedException {
             lock.lock();
             try {
                 // Critical section
                 while (isEmpty()) {
                     notEmpty.await(); // Wait until not empty
                 }
                 // Perform the take operation
                 // ...
                 notFull.signal(); // Signal not full
                 return 0; // Placeholder return value
             } finally {
                 lock.unlock();
             }
         }

         private boolean isFull() {
             // Check if the buffer is full
             return false; // Placeholder condition
         }

         private boolean isEmpty() {
             // Check if the buffer is empty
             return false; // Placeholder condition
         }
     }
     ```

### **Locks vs. Synchronized:**
   - While locks provide additional features and flexibility, for simple scenarios, the `synchronized` keyword may be more convenient.

   - **Synchronized Example:**
     ```java
     class Counter {
         private int count = 0;

         public synchronized void increment() {
             count++;
         }

         public int getCount() {
             return count;
         }
     }
     ```

**Note:**
   - Always release the lock in a `finally` block to ensure it's released even if an exception occurs.
   - Locks provide better control in more complex scenarios, such as implementing fair locking, multiple condition variables, and interruptible locking.
   - Choose the appropriate lock implementation based on the specific requirements of your application.
## **Deadlock, livelock, and how to avoid them**

### **Deadlock:**

Deadlock is a situation in a multithreaded program where two or more threads cannot proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a lock or resource. In other words, they are stuck in a cycle of waiting, and none of them can move forward.

**Example:**
```java
public class DeadlockExample {
    private final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public void method1() {
        synchronized (lock1) {
            System.out.println("Method 1 acquired lock1");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Method 1 acquired lock2");
            }
        }
    }

    public void method2() {
        synchronized (lock2) {
            System.out.println("Method 2 acquired lock2");
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Method 2 acquired lock1");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DeadlockExample deadlockExample = new DeadlockExample();

        new Thread(deadlockExample::method1).start();
        new Thread(deadlockExample::method2).start();
    }
}
```

### **How to Avoid Deadlock:**
1. **Lock Ordering:**
   - Establish a global order for acquiring locks and ensure that all threads follow this order when acquiring multiple locks.

2. **Lock Timeout:**
   - Use lock timeouts. If a thread cannot acquire a lock within a certain time, it releases the acquired locks and retries.

3. **Avoid Nested Locks:**
   - Try to avoid acquiring multiple locks inside a critical section. If you must, make sure the locks are acquired and released in the same order.

4. **Use `tryLock()`:**
   - Instead of using `synchronized`, use `ReentrantLock` and its `tryLock()` method, which allows you to specify a timeout.

### **Livelock:**

Livelock is a situation where two or more threads keep responding to each other's actions, preventing any of them from making progress. While the threads are not blocked, they are unable to complete their tasks.

**Example:**
```java
public class LivelockExample {
    private boolean sharedResource = false;

    public void thread1() {
        while (!sharedResource) {
            System.out.println("Thread 1 is waiting...");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Thread 1 completes its task.");
    }

    public void thread2() {
        while (sharedResource) {
            System.out.println("Thread 2 is waiting...");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Thread 2 completes its task.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LivelockExample livelockExample = new LivelockExample();

        new Thread(livelockExample::thread1).start();
        new Thread(livelockExample::thread2).start();
    }
}
```

### **How to Avoid Livelock:**
1. **Introduce Randomness:**
   - Introduce randomness or variability into the decision-making process to break the deadlock.

2. **Use Timeout:**
   - Similar to deadlock prevention, use timeouts to prevent livelock. If a thread cannot make progress within a certain time, introduce a random delay and retry.

3. **Backoff Strategy:**
   - Implement a backoff strategy where threads back off for a short period before retrying.

4. **Reevaluate Design:**
   - Reevaluate the design of the threads and their interactions to minimize the chance of livelock situations.
