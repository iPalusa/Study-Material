# **6. Daemon Threads**

### **Daemon vs. Non-daemon threads**
In Java, threads can be categorized as daemon threads or non-daemon threads based on their behavior and characteristics. Understanding the distinction between daemon and non-daemon threads is essential for managing the lifecycle of threads within a Java program.

**1. Daemon Threads:**

- **Definition:**
  - Daemon threads are background threads that do not prevent the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from exiting when all non-daemon threads have completed.

- **Characteristics:**
  - Daemon threads are typically used for tasks that run in the background and are not critical for the main application to complete its execution.
  - When all non-daemon threads complete their execution, the JVM terminates, and any remaining daemon threads are abruptly stopped.
  - Daemon threads are created by calling the `setDaemon(true)` method on a `Thread` object before starting it.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  public class DaemonThreadExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
              while (true) {
                  System.out.println("Daemon thread is running in the background");
                  try {
                      Thread.sleep(1000);
                  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                      e.printStackTrace();
                  }
              }
          });

          daemonThread.setDaemon(true);
          daemonThread.start();

          System.out.println("Main thread exits, and daemon thread stops automatically");
      }
  }
  ```

**2. Non-daemon Threads:**

- **Definition:**
  - Non-daemon threads are threads that do prevent the JVM from exiting until they complete their execution.

- **Characteristics:**
  - Non-daemon threads are considered essential for the application's functionality, and the JVM waits for them to finish before terminating.
  - By default, threads created in Java are non-daemon threads.
  - To set a thread as non-daemon explicitly, the `setDaemon(false)` method can be called, although this is not necessary as it's the default behavior.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  public class NonDaemonThreadExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Thread nonDaemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
              for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                  System.out.println("Non-daemon thread is running: " + i);
                  try {
                      Thread.sleep(1000);
                  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                      e.printStackTrace();
                  }
              }
          });

          // Setting as non-daemon (optional, as it's the default)
          nonDaemonThread.setDaemon(false);

          nonDaemonThread.start();

          System.out.println("Main thread exits only after non-daemon thread completes");
      }
  }
  ```

**Summary:**

- Daemon threads are background threads that do not prevent the JVM from exiting, while non-daemon threads are critical threads for the application's completion.
- Daemon threads are set using `setDaemon(true)`, and non-daemon threads are the default behavior.
- Daemon threads automatically stop when all non-daemon threads finish, even if the daemon thread is still running.

### **Daemon thread usage and considerations**

Daemon threads in Java are background threads that do not prevent the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from exiting when all non-daemon threads have completed their execution. Daemon threads are typically used for tasks that run in the background and are not essential for the main application to complete its execution. Here are some considerations and use cases for daemon threads:

**1. Background Task Execution:**
   - Daemon threads are suitable for running tasks that run in the background and don't need to complete for the program to finish.

**2. Automatic Termination:**
   - When all non-daemon threads have completed, the JVM automatically terminates, and any remaining daemon threads are abruptly stopped. This can be useful for cleanup tasks that can be safely terminated if the main application has finished.

**3. Resource Cleanup:**
   - Daemon threads can be used for resource cleanup tasks such as log flushing, periodic maintenance, or monitoring.

**4. Garbage Collection:**
   - Daemon threads are often used in conjunction with tasks that involve resource management, including garbage collection or other periodic cleanup operations.

**5. Continuous Background Processing:**
   - For continuous background processing, such as monitoring system resources or handling asynchronous events, daemon threads can be employed.

**Usage Example:**

```java
public class DaemonThreadUsage {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Daemon thread is running in the background");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        // Set as daemon thread
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);

        daemonThread.start();

        // Main thread doing some work
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Main thread is working: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1500);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        // Main thread exits, and daemon thread stops automatically
        System.out.println("Main thread exits, and daemon thread stops automatically");
    }
}
```

In this example, a daemon thread is created to run in the background, continuously printing a message. The main thread performs some work and then exits. The JVM automatically terminates when the main thread exits, and the daemon thread is stopped abruptly.

**Considerations:**

- **No Cleanup Guarantee:**
  - Daemon threads should not be used for tasks that require cleanup or proper termination, as there is no guarantee that they will complete their tasks before being terminated.

- **Careful Resource Management:**
  - Daemon threads should be used with caution, and proper resource management should be considered to avoid resource leaks or incomplete tasks.

- **Thread Safety:**
  - Ensure that daemon threads do not interfere with the state of non-daemon threads or share critical resources that may lead to race conditions.

- **No Finalization Guarantee:**
  - Daemon threads are not guaranteed to run the `finalize` method before being terminated, so relying on finalization for cleanup in daemon threads is not recommended.
