# 7.**Thread Safety**

### **Immutable objects**

Immutable objects are objects whose state cannot be modified after they are created. Once an immutable object is instantiated, its internal state remains constant throughout its lifetime. Immutable objects are particularly useful in multithreaded and concurrent programming, as they eliminate the need for synchronization and reduce the chances of race conditions.

Characteristics of Immutable Objects:

1. **State Cannot Change:**
   - The internal state of an immutable object cannot be modified after it has been created. Any operation that appears to modify the state actually returns a new object with the updated state.

2. **No Setters:**
   - Immutable objects typically lack setter methods. Construction and initialization of the object are done in the constructor, and there are no methods that allow external modification of the object's fields.

3. **Fields Are Final:**
   - Fields of an immutable object are often declared as `final`. This ensures that they are assigned a value only once, usually during the object's construction.

4. **No Mutable References:**
   - If the immutable object contains references to other objects, those references should also point to immutable objects or be treated in a way that ensures their immutability.

5. **Thread Safety:**
   - Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe. Since their state cannot change, they can be safely shared among multiple threads without the need for locks or synchronization.

**Advantages of Immutable Objects:**

1. **Thread Safety:**
   - Immutable objects simplify concurrent programming by eliminating the need for locks and synchronization. Since their state is fixed, there are no race conditions.

2. **Simple and Predictable:**
   - Immutable objects provide a clear and predictable state. Once constructed, they remain in a well-defined state throughout their lifecycle.

3. **Security:**
   - Immutable objects are inherently more secure, as their state cannot be altered. This makes them suitable for scenarios where the integrity of the data is crucial.

4. **Hashcode and Equals:**
   - Immutable objects can use their internal state for hashcode and equals implementations, as this state is constant. This ensures consistency in hash-based collections.

5. **Easier to Reason About:**
   - Code that involves immutable objects is often simpler and easier to reason about, as there are no side effects or unexpected changes in state.

**Example of an Immutable Object:**

```java
public final class ImmutablePerson {
    private final String firstName;
    private final String lastName;

    public ImmutablePerson(String firstName, String lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    public ImmutablePerson withFirstName(String newFirstName) {
        return new ImmutablePerson(newFirstName, this.lastName);
    }

    public ImmutablePerson withLastName(String newLastName) {
        return new ImmutablePerson(this.firstName, newLastName);
    }
}
```

In this example, `ImmutablePerson` is an immutable class with two final fields (firstName and lastName). The constructor initializes these fields, and there are no setter methods. Instead, the class provides methods (`withFirstName` and `withLastName`) that return new instances with the desired changes, maintaining immutability.

### **Volatile keyword**

The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value may be changed by multiple threads simultaneously. It informs the compiler and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that the variable can be accessed and modified by multiple threads, and certain optimizations that might reorder or cache the variable's value should be avoided. The `volatile` keyword is primarily used for variables shared among multiple threads to ensure visibility and prevent certain types of data races.

Key Characteristics of `volatile`:

1. **Visibility:**
   - The `volatile` keyword guarantees visibility of changes made by one thread to all other threads. When a thread writes to a `volatile` variable, the updated value is immediately visible to all other threads reading the variable.

2. **No Atomicity:**
   - While `volatile` ensures visibility, it does not provide atomicity for compound actions. For example, if a thread performs a read-modify-write operation on a `volatile` variable, it may still be interrupted between the read and write operations.

3. **No Locking Overhead:**
   - Unlike using locks or synchronization, the `volatile` keyword avoids the overhead associated with acquiring and releasing locks. It is a lighter-weight synchronization mechanism suitable for certain scenarios.

4. **No Reordering Optimization:**
   - The `volatile` keyword prevents the compiler and the JVM from reordering code to optimize execution. This ensures that reads and writes to the variable occur in the expected order.

**Example Usage of `volatile`:**

```java
public class SharedResource {
    private volatile boolean flag = false;

    public void setFlagTrue() {
        flag = true;
    }

    public boolean isFlagSet() {
        return flag;
    }
}
```

In this example, `flag` is declared as a `volatile` boolean variable. Multiple threads can call `setFlagTrue` to set the flag to `true`, and other threads can call `isFlagSet` to check the flag's value. The use of `volatile` ensures that changes to the flag made by one thread are immediately visible to other threads.

**When to Use `volatile`:**

- Use `volatile` when a variable is shared among multiple threads, and you want to ensure visibility of changes made by one thread to all other threads.

- Use `volatile` when the variable is not involved in compound actions that require atomicity. For atomic operations, consider other synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks or the use of the `java.util.concurrent` package.

**Limitations and Considerations:**

- `volatile` is not a substitute for other synchronization mechanisms if compound operations require atomicity.

- Use `volatile` judiciously; it may not be suitable for all scenarios, especially when multiple operations need to be performed atomically.

- For more complex synchronization requirements, consider using locks, atomic classes, or other higher-level concurrency constructs provided by the Java concurrency utilities.

### **Atomic classes**

Java provides a set of atomic classes in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package that are designed to support atomic operations on variables. These classes are particularly useful in scenarios where multiple threads may access and modify shared variables concurrently, and you want to ensure atomicity without using explicit locks. Atomic classes offer thread-safe, atomic operations without the need for explicit synchronization.

Here are some key atomic classes in Java:

1. **AtomicBoolean:**
   - Provides atomic operations for `boolean` variables.

   ```java
   AtomicBoolean atomicBoolean = new AtomicBoolean(true);
   boolean previousValue = atomicBoolean.getAndSet(false);
   ```

2. **AtomicInteger:**
   - Provides atomic operations for `int` variables.

   ```java
   AtomicInteger atomicInteger = new AtomicInteger(0);
   int incrementedValue = atomicInteger.incrementAndGet();
   ```

3. **AtomicLong:**
   - Provides atomic operations for `long` variables.

   ```java
   AtomicLong atomicLong = new AtomicLong(0L);
   long addedValue = atomicLong.addAndGet(10L);
   ```

4. **AtomicReference:**
   - Provides atomic operations for reference variables (objects).

   ```java
   AtomicReference<String> atomicReference = new AtomicReference<>("initialValue");
   String newValue = "newValue";
   atomicReference.compareAndSet("initialValue", newValue);
   ```

5. **AtomicIntegerArray:**
   - An array of integers in which elements may be updated atomically.

   ```java
   AtomicIntegerArray atomicIntArray = new AtomicIntegerArray(new int[]{1, 2, 3});
   atomicIntArray.getAndIncrement(1);
   ```

6. **AtomicLongArray:**
   - An array of longs in which elements may be updated atomically.

   ```java
   AtomicLongArray atomicLongArray = new AtomicLongArray(new long[]{10L, 20L, 30L});
   atomicLongArray.getAndAdd(2, 5L);
   ```

7. **AtomicReferenceArray:**
   - An array of object references in which elements may be updated atomically.

   ```java
   AtomicReferenceArray<String> atomicRefArray = new AtomicReferenceArray<>(new String[]{"A", "B", "C"});
   atomicRefArray.compareAndSet(1, "B", "X");
   ```

### **Key Features and Considerations:**

- **Atomic Operations:**
  - Atomic classes provide methods like `getAndSet`, `incrementAndGet`, `compareAndSet`, etc., ensuring that these operations are executed atomically without explicit locks.

- **Thread Safety:**
  - Atomic classes are designed for use in multithreaded environments and offer thread safety without the need for external synchronization.

- **Performance:**
  - For simple atomic operations, atomic classes are generally more efficient than using explicit locks. However, for more complex scenarios, locks or other concurrency constructs may be more appropriate.

- **Limited to Individual Operations:**
  - Atomic classes are suitable for individual atomic operations but may not be sufficient for compound actions that require multiple steps to be performed atomically.

- **Immutability and Lock-Free Algorithms:**
  - In some scenarios, immutability or lock-free algorithms may provide alternatives to atomic classes, depending on the specific requirements of your application.
