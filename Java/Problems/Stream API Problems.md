1. **Filter and Count:**
   - Read a list of strings, filter out those with length greater than 10, and count the remaining ones.

2. **Object Transformation:**
   - Given a list of objects, transform each object by concatenating two string fields and converting the result to uppercase.

3. **Distinct Values:**
   - Read a list of integers, square each value, and then find the distinct values in the resulting list.

4. **Grouping by Property:**
   - Group a list of objects by a specific property, and calculate the average of another numeric property for each group.

5. **FlatMap Challenge:**
   - Given a list of lists of integers, flatten the structure and find the sum of all distinct elements.

6. **Filter Map Entries:**
   - Read a map of string keys and integer values, filter out entries with values less than 100, and print the remaining entries.

7. **Sorting Objects:**
   - Sort a list of objects based on a numeric property in descending order.

8. **Parallel Processing:**
   - Utilize parallel streams to process a large list of strings, concatenate them, and find the distinct characters.

9. **Partitioning by Predicate:**
   - Partition a list of objects into two groups based on a boolean property.

10. **Custom Collector:**
    - Create a custom collector to concatenate the string properties of a list of objects into a single comma-separated string.

11. **Chaining Operations:**
    - Read a list of objects, filter them based on a condition, map to a different object type, and then perform a distinct operation.

12. **Nested Maps:**
    - Given a map with string keys and lists of objects as values, flatten the structure and find the total count of objects.

13. **Peek and Collect:**
    - Use peek to log intermediate results during the stream processing and collect the final result in a specific format.

14. **Reduce Challenge:**
    - Read a list of integers, calculate the product of all even numbers using the reduce operation.

15. **Combine Streams:**
    - Merge two lists of objects, filter out duplicates, and then perform a specific operation on the resulting list.

16. **Stream from Map:**
    - Read a map and create a stream of its entries, filter out entries with specific conditions, and collect them into a new map.

17. **String Manipulation:**
    - Given a list of strings, concatenate them into a single string, and then find the count of a specific character.

18. **Optional and Streams:**
    - Process a list of objects, extract a nullable property, and convert it to an Optional. Filter out empty optionals and perform an operation.

19. **Distinct Properties:**
    - Read a list of objects, extract a specific property, and find the distinct values of that property.

20. **Skip and Limit:**
    - Read a list of objects, skip the first 5 elements, and then limit the remaining ones to 10.

21. **Collecting to Set:**
    - Read a list of objects, extract a property, and collect it into a Set. Print the size of the set.

22. **Custom Comparator:**
    - Sort a list of objects based on multiple properties using a custom comparator.

23. **Concatenate Maps:**
    - Given two maps with string keys and integer values, concatenate them, sum values for duplicate keys, and create a new map.

24. **Collecting Statistics:**
    - Read a list of objects, extract a numeric property, and use the summarizing collector to get statistics like count, sum, min, max, and average.

25. **Error Handling with Streams:**
    - Process a list of strings, convert each to an integer, handle exceptions gracefully, and collect the valid results.
