1. **Filtering with Lambda Expressions:**
   - Use lambda expressions to filter elements in an array based on a specific condition, such as finding all even numbers or strings starting with a certain letter.

2. **Mapping with Lambda Expressions:**
   - Apply lambda expressions to transform elements in an array, converting them to a different data type or modifying their values.

3. **Sorting Objects with Lambda Comparators:**
   - Sort an array of custom objects using lambda expressions for comparator functions, enabling flexible and dynamic sorting based on different object attributes.

4. **Grouping with Lambda and Collectors:**
   - Group objects in a list or array based on a specific property using lambda expressions and the `Collectors.groupingBy` collector.

5. **Filter and Transform Maps:**
   - Use lambda expressions to filter and transform entries in a map, creating a new map with specific key-value pairs that meet certain criteria.

6. **Object Initialization with Lambda:**
   - Initialize a collection of objects using lambda expressions, providing concise and expressive ways to create instances with specific attributes.

7. **Chaining Lambda Expressions:**
   - Chain multiple lambda expressions together to perform complex operations on arrays or lists, showcasing the composability of functional programming in Java.

8. **Stream API and Lambda:**
   - Utilize the Stream API along with lambda expressions to process arrays or collections in a functional and declarative manner, performing operations like mapping, filtering, and reducing.

9. **Parallel Processing with Lambda and Streams:**
   - Experiment with parallel streams and lambda expressions to perform concurrent processing on large arrays or collections, optimizing performance.

10. **Predicate Composition with Lambda:**
    - Combine multiple predicates using lambda expressions to create complex filtering conditions for arrays or collections.

11. **BiFunction and Object Transformation:**
    - Use the `BiFunction` interface along with lambda expressions to transform objects based on two input parameters, showcasing versatile object manipulation.

12. **FlatMap for Nested Collections:**
    - Apply lambda expressions and the `flatMap` operation to process and flatten nested collections within objects or maps.

13. **Custom Collector with Lambda:**
    - Create a custom collector using lambda expressions to accumulate and combine elements in a unique way, demonstrating advanced usage of the `Collector` interface.

14. **Memoization with Lambda:**
    - Implement memoization using lambda expressions to cache and reuse the results of expensive function calls, improving performance in certain scenarios.

15. **Event Handling with Lambda:**
    - Use lambda expressions for event handling in GUI applications, demonstrating their concise syntax for defining actions associated with user interactions on objects.
