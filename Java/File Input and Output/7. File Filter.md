File filtering in Java refers to the process of selecting or excluding files based on specific criteria when working with directories. Java provides a mechanism for filtering files using interfaces like `FileFilter` and `FilenameFilter`. These interfaces are particularly useful when you need to process only a subset of files that meet certain conditions.

### `FileFilter` Interface:

The `FileFilter` interface is used to filter files based on various criteria. It has a single method:

```java
public interface FileFilter {
    boolean accept(File pathname);
}
```

- The `accept(File pathname)` method is called for each file in a directory, and it returns `true` if the file should be accepted, or `false` if it should be excluded.

#### Example using `FileFilter`:

Suppose you want to filter and display only text files in a directory:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileFilter;

public class TextFileFilter implements FileFilter {
    @Override
    public boolean accept(File pathname) {
        return pathname.isFile() && pathname.getName().toLowerCase().endsWith(".txt");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File directory = new File("path/to/directory");
        File[] textFiles = directory.listFiles(new TextFileFilter());

        for (File file : textFiles) {
            System.out.println(file.getName());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `TextFileFilter` class implements the `FileFilter` interface, and the `accept` method filters only files with a ".txt" extension.

### `FilenameFilter` Interface:

The `FilenameFilter` interface is another option for file filtering. It filters files based on their names. It has a single method:

```java
public interface FilenameFilter {
    boolean accept(File dir, String name);
}
```

- The `accept(File dir, String name)` method is called for each file in a directory, and it returns `true` if the file should be accepted, or `false` if it should be excluded.

#### Example using `FilenameFilter`:

Suppose you want to filter and display only files that start with "data":

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FilenameFilter;

public class DataFileFilter implements FilenameFilter {
    @Override
    public boolean accept(File dir, String name) {
        return name.startsWith("data");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File directory = new File("path/to/directory");
        String[] dataFiles = directory.list(new DataFileFilter());

        for (String fileName : dataFiles) {
            System.out.println(fileName);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `DataFileFilter` class implements the `FilenameFilter` interface, and the `accept` method filters only files that start with "data."

### Benefits of File Filtering:

1. **Selective Processing:** File filtering allows you to process only those files that meet specific criteria, reducing unnecessary processing.

2. **Customization:** You can easily create custom filters based on your specific requirements.

3. **Readability:** By encapsulating filtering logic in separate classes, your code becomes more readable and modular.

Whether you use `FileFilter` or `FilenameFilter` depends on whether you want to filter based on file properties (e.g., extension) or file names. Both interfaces provide a flexible way to customize file processing in Java.

### Pattern based filtering using regex
Pattern-based filtering using regular expressions allows you to filter files based on more complex and flexible matching criteria. In Java, you can use the `Pattern` class from the `java.util.regex` package to define regular expressions for file filtering. Here's an example:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FilenameFilter;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class RegexFileFilter implements FilenameFilter {
    private final Pattern pattern;

    public RegexFileFilter(String regex) {
        this.pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean accept(File dir, String name) {
        return pattern.matcher(name).matches();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example: Filter files with names starting with "log" and ending with ".txt"
        RegexFileFilter regexFilter = new RegexFileFilter("^log.*\\.txt$");

        File directory = new File("path/to/directory");
        String[] matchingFiles = directory.list(regexFilter);

        if (matchingFiles != null) {
            for (String fileName : matchingFiles) {
                System.out.println(fileName);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `RegexFileFilter` class implements the `FilenameFilter` interface.
- It takes a regular expression as a parameter in its constructor.
- The `accept` method checks if the file name matches the regular expression using `Pattern.matcher(name).matches()`.

### Example Regular Expressions:

- `^log.*\.txt$`: Matches file names starting with "log" and ending with ".txt".
- `.*\.java$`: Matches file names ending with ".java".
- `^data_\d+\.csv$`: Matches file names starting with "data_" followed by one or more digits and ending with ".csv".
