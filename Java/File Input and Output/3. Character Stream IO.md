# Character Stream Classes

## Reader and Writer hierarchies
- The `Reader` class is the abstract base class for all classes that read characters. It provides a basic set of methods for reading characters from a source.
- The `Writer` class is the abstract base class for all classes that write characters. It provides a basic set of methods for writing characters to a destination.

## FileReader and FileWriter
**`FileReader`**

The FileReader class is used for reading character data from a file. It makes it easy to read the contents of a file as a stream of characters.
```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("path/to/textFile.txt")) {
            int character;
            while ((character = reader.read()) != -1) {
                // Process the character
                System.out.print((char) character);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, FileReader is used to read characters from a text file. The read() method returns the next character from the file as an integer, and -1 indicates the end of the file.

**`FileWriter`**

The FileWriter class is used for writing character data to a file. It allows you to write characters to a file in a convenient way.
```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriterExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("path/to/outputFile.txt")) {
            String dataToWrite = "Hello, FileWriter!";
            writer.write(dataToWrite);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, FileWriter is used to write a string to a text file. The write(String str) method writes the specified string to the file.
### Methods:
The `FileReader` and `FileWriter` classes in Java have specific methods for reading and writing characters to and from files. Here are some exclusive methods of `FileReader` and `FileWriter`:

#### `FileReader`:

1. **`read(char[] cbuf)` Method:**
   - `int read(char[] cbuf) throws IOException`: Reads characters into an array. It reads up to `cbuf.length` characters from the file and returns the number of characters read or `-1` if the end of the file is reached.

    ```java
    try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("path/to/textFile.txt")) {
        char[] buffer = new char[1024];
        int bytesRead;
        while ((bytesRead = reader.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            // Process the characters in the buffer
            System.out.print(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```

#### `FileWriter`:

1. **`write(char[] cbuf)` Method:**
   - `void write(char[] cbuf) throws IOException`: Writes an array of characters to the file.

    ```java
    try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("path/to/outputFile.txt")) {
        char[] dataToWrite = "Hello, FileWriter!".toCharArray();
        writer.write(dataToWrite);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```

2. **`write(String str)` Method:**
   - `void write(String str) throws IOException`: Writes a string to the file.

    ```java
    try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("path/to/outputFile.txt")) {
        String dataToWrite = "Hello, FileWriter!";
        writer.write(dataToWrite);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```

3. **`write(String str, int off, int len)` Method:**
   - `void write(String str, int off, int len) throws IOException`: Writes a portion of a string to the file.

    ```java
    try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("path/to/outputFile.txt")) {
        String dataToWrite = "Hello, FileWriter!";
        writer.write(dataToWrite, 0, 5); // Writes "Hello"
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```
### BufferedReader and BufferedWriter
### `BufferedReader`
`BufferedReader` is a class in Java that is part of the `java.io` package. It is used for efficient reading of characters from a character-based input stream. `BufferedReader` is often employed to wrap around other `Reader` objects, providing buffering functionality, which can significantly improve the performance of reading operations.

The key feature of BufferedReader is its buffering functionality. When you read data from a stream, it's often more efficient to read a chunk of data at once rather than one character at a time. BufferedReader stores a buffer of characters, and when you request characters, it reads them from the underlying stream in larger chunks, reducing the number of actual I/O operations.
Here's a brief explanation of `BufferedReader` and its methods along with examples:

#### `BufferedReader` Constructors:

1. **`BufferedReader(Reader in)` Constructor:**
   - Creates a new `BufferedReader`, providing buffering for the specified `Reader`.

    ```java
    FileReader fileReader = new FileReader("path/to/textFile.txt");
    BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);
    ```

#### `BufferedReader` Methods:

1. **`read()` Method:**
   - `int read() throws IOException`: Reads a single character from the input stream. Returns the character as an integer, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.

    ```java
    int charCode = bufferedReader.read();
    ```

2. **`read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)` Method:**
   - `int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException`: Reads characters into a portion of an array. Returns the number of characters read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.

    ```java
    char[] buffer = new char[1024];
    int bytesRead = bufferedReader.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length);
    ```

3. **`readLine()` Method:**
   - `String readLine() throws IOException`: Reads a line of text. Returns a `String` containing the contents of the line, excluding any line-termination characters.

    ```java
    String line = bufferedReader.readLine();
    ```

4. **`lines()` Method:**
   - `Stream<String> lines()`: Returns a `Stream` of lines from this `BufferedReader`.

    ```java
    try (Stream<String> lines = bufferedReader.lines()) {
        lines.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
    ```

5. **`skip(long n)` Method:**
   - `long skip(long n) throws IOException`: Skips characters from the input stream. Returns the number of characters skipped.

    ```java
    long charactersSkipped = bufferedReader.skip(10);
    ```

6. **`mark(int readAheadLimit)` and `reset()` Methods:**
   - `void mark(int readAheadLimit) throws IOException`: Marks the present position in the stream.
   - `void reset() throws IOException`: Resets the stream to the most recent mark.

    ```java
    bufferedReader.mark(100); // Mark the current position
    // ... perform some read operations ...
    bufferedReader.reset(); // Reset to the marked position
    ```

7. **`ready()` Method:**
   - `boolean ready() throws IOException`: Tells whether the stream is ready to be read.

    ```java
    boolean isReady = bufferedReader.ready();
    ```

8. **`close()` Method:**
   - `void close() throws IOException`: Closes the stream.

    ```java
    bufferedReader.close();
    ```

#### Example Usage:

```java
try (BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("path/to/textFile.txt"))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, a `BufferedReader` is used to read lines from a text file efficiently. The `readLine()` method is used to read each line, and the loop continues until the end of the file is reached (`readLine()` returns `null`). The resource management is handled by the try-with-resources statement, ensuring that the `BufferedReader` is closed properly after use.

### `BufferedWriter`

`BufferedWriter` is a class in Java that is part of the `java.io` package. It is used for efficient writing of characters to a character-based output stream. Similar to `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter` provides buffering functionality, which can significantly improve the performance of writing operations by reducing the number of I/O operations.

Here's an overview of `BufferedWriter` and its usage:

#### `BufferedWriter` Constructors:

1. **`BufferedWriter(Writer out)` Constructor:**
   - Creates a new `BufferedWriter`, providing buffering for the specified `Writer`.

    ```java
    FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("path/to/outputFile.txt");
    BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(fileWriter);
    ```

#### `BufferedWriter` Methods:

1. **`write(int c)` Method:**
   - `void write(int c) throws IOException`: Writes a single character to the output stream.

    ```java
    bufferedWriter.write('A');
    ```

2. **`write(char[] cbuf)` Method:**
   - `void write(char[] cbuf) throws IOException`: Writes an array of characters to the output stream.

    ```java
    char[] dataToWrite = "Hello, BufferedWriter!".toCharArray();
    bufferedWriter.write(dataToWrite);
    ```

3. **`write(String str)` Method:**
   - `void write(String str) throws IOException`: Writes a string to the output stream.

    ```java
    String dataToWrite = "Hello, BufferedWriter!";
    bufferedWriter.write(dataToWrite);
    ```

4. **`write(String str, int off, int len)` Method:**
   - `void write(String str, int off, int len) throws IOException`: Writes a portion of a string to the output stream.

    ```java
    String dataToWrite = "Hello, BufferedWriter!";
    bufferedWriter.write(dataToWrite, 0, 5); // Writes "Hello"
    ```

5. **`newLine()` Method:**
   - `void newLine() throws IOException`: Writes a line separator. The line separator is system-dependent.

    ```java
    bufferedWriter.write("Line 1");
    bufferedWriter.newLine(); // Writes a line separator
    bufferedWriter.write("Line 2");
    ```

6. **`flush()` Method:**
   - `void flush() throws IOException`: Flushes the stream. This ensures that any buffered data is written to the underlying stream.

    ```java
    bufferedWriter.flush();
    ```

7. **`close()` Method:**
   - `void close() throws IOException`: Closes the stream. This method also flushes the stream before closing it.

    ```java
    bufferedWriter.close();
    ```

#### Example Usage:

```java
try (BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("path/to/outputFile.txt"))) {
    String line1 = "Hello, BufferedWriter!";
    String line2 = "This is a new line.";

    bufferedWriter.write(line1);
    bufferedWriter.newLine(); // Writes a line separator
    bufferedWriter.write(line2);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, `BufferedWriter` is used to efficiently write lines to a text file. The `newLine()` method is used to write a platform-specific line separator, and the `try-with-resources` statement ensures proper resource management.

## CharArrayReader and CharArrayWriter

`CharArrayReader`

`CharArrayReader` is a class in Java that is part of the `java.io` package. It allows an application to create an input stream from a character array. This class is particularly useful when you need to treat a character array as a source of character input, such as reading from a `char[]` directly rather than from a file or other types of streams.

Here's an overview of `CharArrayReader` and its usage:

### `CharArrayReader` Constructors:

1. **`CharArrayReader(char[] buf)` Constructor:**
   - Creates a new `CharArrayReader` with the specified character array.

    ```java
    char[] charArray = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};
    CharArrayReader charArrayReader = new CharArrayReader(charArray);
    ```

2. **`CharArrayReader(char[] buf, int offset, int length)` Constructor:**
   - Creates a new `CharArrayReader` with the specified character array, offset, and length.

    ```java
    char[] charArray = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};
    CharArrayReader charArrayReader = new CharArrayReader(charArray, 1, 3); // Reads 'e', 'l', 'l'
    ```

### `CharArrayReader` Methods:

1. **`read()` Method:**
   - `int read() throws IOException`: Reads a single character from the input stream. Returns the character as an integer, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.

    ```java
    int charCode = charArrayReader.read();
    ```

2. **`read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)` Method:**
   - `int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException`: Reads characters into a portion of an array. Returns the number of characters read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.

    ```java
    char[] buffer = new char[3];
    int bytesRead = charArrayReader.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length);
    ```

3. **`ready()` Method:**
   - `boolean ready() throws IOException`: Tells whether the stream is ready to be read.

    ```java
    boolean isReady = charArrayReader.ready();
    ```

4. **`mark(int readAheadLimit)` and `reset()` Methods:**
   - `void mark(int readAheadLimit) throws IOException`: Marks the present position in the stream.
   - `void reset() throws IOException`: Resets the stream to the most recent mark.

    ```java
    charArrayReader.mark(3); // Mark the current position
    // ... perform some read operations ...
    charArrayReader.reset(); // Reset to the marked position
    ```

5. **`close()` Method:**
   - `void close() throws IOException`: Closes the stream.

    ```java
    charArrayReader.close();
    ```

### Example Usage:

```java
char[] charArray = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};
try (CharArrayReader charArrayReader = new CharArrayReader(charArray)) {
    int charCode;
    while ((charCode = charArrayReader.read()) != -1) {
        char character = (char) charCode;
        System.out.print(character);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, `CharArrayReader` is used to read characters from a `char[]` array. The `read()` method is used to read characters one by one, and the `try-with-resources` statement ensures that the `CharArrayReader` is closed properly after use.

## InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter

`InputStreamReader`

`InputStreamReader` is a class in Java that is part of the `java.io` package. It is a bridge between byte streams and character streams, allowing you to read characters from an `InputStream` by converting the bytes using a specified character encoding. This class is particularly useful when dealing with byte-oriented input streams, such as `FileInputStream` or `Socket.getInputStream()`, and you want to interpret the bytes as characters.

Here's an overview of `InputStreamReader` and its usage:

### `InputStreamReader` Constructors:

1. **`InputStreamReader(InputStream in)` Constructor:**
   - Creates an `InputStreamReader` that uses the default character encoding.

    ```java
    InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/textFile.txt");
    InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream);
    ```

2. **`InputStreamReader(InputStream in, Charset cs)` Constructor:**
   - Creates an `InputStreamReader` that uses the specified character encoding.

    ```java
    InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/textFile.txt");
    Charset charset = Charset.forName("UTF-8");
    InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, charset);
    ```

3. **`InputStreamReader(InputStream in, String charsetName)` Constructor:**
   - Creates an `InputStreamReader` that uses the specified character encoding by name.

    ```java
    InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/textFile.txt");
    InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, "UTF-8");
    ```

### `InputStreamReader` Methods:

1. **`read()` Method:**
   - `int read() throws IOException`: Reads a single character from the input stream. Returns the character as an integer, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.

    ```java
    int character = inputStreamReader.read();
    ```

2. **`read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)` Method:**
   - `int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len) throws IOException`: Reads characters into a portion of an array. Returns the number of characters read, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached.

    ```java
    char[] buffer = new char[1024];
    int bytesRead = inputStreamReader.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length);
    ```

3. **`close()` Method:**
   - `void close() throws IOException`: Closes the stream.

    ```java
    inputStreamReader.close();
    ```

4. **`getEncoding()` Method:**
   - `String getEncoding()`: Returns the name of the character encoding being used.

    ```java
    String encoding = inputStreamReader.getEncoding();
    ```

### Example Usage:

```java
try (InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/textFile.txt");
     InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {

    char[] buffer = new char[1024];
    int bytesRead;

    while ((bytesRead = inputStreamReader.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length)) != -1) {
        // Process the characters read from the file
        System.out.print(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));
    }

} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, `InputStreamReader` is used to read characters from a text file (`FileInputStream`). The `read()` method is employed to read characters into a buffer, and the loop continues until the end of the file is reached. The `try-with-resources` statement ensures proper resource management by automatically closing the streams. The character encoding UTF-8 is specified, but you can choose a different encoding based on your requirements.

`InputStreamWriter`

`InputStreamWriter` is a class in Java that serves as a bridge between byte streams and character streams. It converts bytes received from an input stream into characters using a specified character encoding. This class is part of the `java.io` package and is commonly used when reading from byte-oriented input streams, such as `FileInputStream` or `SocketInputStream`, and you need to interpret the bytes as characters.

Here's an overview of `InputStreamWriter` and its usage:

### `InputStreamWriter` Constructors:

1. **`InputStreamWriter(InputStream in)` Constructor:**
   - Creates an `InputStreamWriter` that uses the default character encoding.

    ```java
    InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/file.txt");
    InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream);
    ```

2. **`InputStreamWriter(InputStream in, String charsetName)` Constructor:**
   - Creates an `InputStreamWriter` that uses a specified character encoding.

    ```java
    InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/file.txt");
    String charsetName = "UTF-8";
    InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, charsetName);
    ```

3. **`InputStreamWriter(InputStream in, Charset cs)` Constructor:**
   - Creates an `InputStreamWriter` that uses a specified character set.

    ```java
    InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/file.txt");
    Charset charset = StandardCharsets.UTF_8;
    InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, charset);
    ```

### `InputStreamWriter` Methods:

1. **`read()` Method:**
   - `int read() throws IOException`: Reads a single character.

    ```java
    int charCode = inputStreamReader.read();
    ```

2. **`read(char[] cbuf, int offset, int length)` Method:**
   - `int read(char[] cbuf, int offset, int length) throws IOException`: Reads characters into an array.

    ```java
    char[] buffer = new char[1024];
    int bytesRead = inputStreamReader.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length);
    ```

3. **`close()` Method:**
   - `void close() throws IOException`: Closes the stream.

    ```java
    inputStreamReader.close();
    ```

### Example Usage:

```java
try (InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/file.txt");
     InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {

    char[] buffer = new char[1024];
    int bytesRead;
    while ((bytesRead = inputStreamReader.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length)) != -1) {
        // Process the characters in the buffer
        System.out.print(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));
    }

} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, `InputStreamWriter` is used to read characters from a file (`FileInputStream`). The character encoding is set to UTF-8, but you can choose a different encoding based on your requirements. The characters are read into a buffer, and the loop continues until the end of the file is reached (`read()` returns `-1`). The `try-with-resources` statement ensures proper resource management, closing the `InputStreamReader` and `InputStream` automatically after use.


### Character Stream Operations
Character stream operations in Java involve reading from or writing to streams that deal with characters. These operations are commonly performed using classes from the `java.io` package. Character streams are used when dealing with text-based data, and they provide more convenient operations than byte streams when working with character-based input or output.

Here are some common character stream operations:

### Reading from a Character-Based Input Stream:

1. **FileReader:**
   - Reading characters from a file using `FileReader`.

    ```java
    try (FileReader fileReader = new FileReader("path/to/textFile.txt")) {
        int charCode;
        while ((charCode = fileReader.read()) != -1) {
            char character = (char) charCode;
            // Process the character
            System.out.print(character);
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```

2. **BufferedReader:**
   - Using `BufferedReader` for efficient reading from a file.

    ```java
    try (BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("path/to/textFile.txt"))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
            // Process each line
            System.out.println(line);
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```

### Writing to a Character-Based Output Stream:

1. **FileWriter:**
   - Writing characters to a file using `FileWriter`.

    ```java
    try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("path/to/outputFile.txt")) {
        String dataToWrite = "Hello, FileWriter!";
        fileWriter.write(dataToWrite);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```

2. **BufferedWriter:**
   - Using `BufferedWriter` for efficient writing to a file.

    ```java
    try (BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("path/to/outputFile.txt"))) {
        String line1 = "Hello, BufferedWriter!";
        String line2 = "This is a new line.";

        bufferedWriter.write(line1);
        bufferedWriter.newLine(); // Writes a line separator
        bufferedWriter.write(line2);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```

3. **PrintWriter:**
   - Utilizing `PrintWriter` for formatted output.

    ```java
    try (PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("path/to/outputFile.txt"))) {
        printWriter.println("Hello, PrintWriter!");
        printWriter.printf("Formatted Number: %d%n", 42);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```

These examples demonstrate basic character stream operations. The choice of classes (`FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedWriter`, etc.) depends on the specific requirements of your application, and you can use them in combination for more complex scenarios. When working with character streams, it's important to handle exceptions appropriately and to close the streams properly, preferably using the `try-with-resources` statement.

### Encoding and decoding

Encoding and decoding refer to the processes of converting data between different representations or formats. These terms are commonly used in the context of character encoding, encryption, and data compression.

1. **Character Encoding:**
   - **Encoding:** The process of converting characters from one character set to another. It involves representing characters as numbers (usually in binary) according to a specific encoding scheme, such as ASCII, UTF-8, or ISO-8859-1.
   - **Decoding:** The reverse process of converting encoded characters back to their original representation.

2. **URL Encoding (Percent Encoding):**
   - **Encoding:** The process of converting special characters in a URL to a format that can be transmitted over the internet. For example, spaces are replaced by "%20".
   - **Decoding:** The reverse process of converting URL-encoded characters back to their original form.

3. **Base64 Encoding:**
   - **Encoding:** The process of converting binary data into a plain text format using a set of characters (64 characters, usually A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "+", and "/").
   - **Decoding:** The reverse process of converting Base64-encoded data back to its original binary form.

4. **Encryption and Decryption:**
   - **Encoding:** In the context of encryption, encoding involves transforming data into a different format using a key or algorithm to make it unreadable without the appropriate decryption key.
   - **Decoding:** The process of reversing the encoding to retrieve the original data.

5. **Data Compression:**
   - **Encoding:** The process of reducing the size of data by representing it in a more efficient form. Methods like Huffman coding or Run-Length Encoding are examples.
   - **Decoding:** The process of reversing the encoding to reconstruct the original data.

6. **HTML Entities:**
   - **Encoding:** Converting special characters in HTML (such as "<", ">", "&") into HTML entities to ensure proper rendering in web browsers.
   - **Decoding:** The reverse process of converting HTML entities back to their original characters.

Understanding encoding and decoding is crucial in various applications, including data transmission, data storage, and security. The choice of encoding or encryption method depends on the specific requirements and the context in which it is applied.
