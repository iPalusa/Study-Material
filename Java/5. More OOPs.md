# 5. More OOPs

## Interfaces and abstract classes

Interfaces and abstract classes are two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that facilitate code organization and design by providing a way to define contracts for classes. Let's explore both concepts in more detail:

**Interfaces:**

An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods (methods without a body) that defines a contract that implementing classes must adhere to. Interfaces serve as a way to establish a common set of methods that multiple classes can implement, promoting code reusability and allowing different classes to share common behaviors.

Key points about interfaces:

1. **Abstract Methods:** Interfaces contain only abstract methods, which are methods declared without an implementation. Implementing classes are required to provide concrete implementations for all methods declared in the interface.

2. **Multiple Inheritance:** Java supports multiple interface inheritance, which means a class can implement multiple interfaces. This allows classes to inherit behaviors from multiple sources.

3. **No Constructor:** Interfaces cannot have constructors because they do not create objects; they define contracts.

4. **Public Access:** Methods in interfaces are implicitly `public` and `abstract`, and fields are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`.

Example of an interface in Java:

```java
public interface Shape {
    double area();    // Abstract method to calculate the area
    double perimeter(); // Abstract method to calculate the perimeter
}
```

Implementing classes are required to provide concrete implementations for the `area` and `perimeter` methods.

**Abstract Classes:**

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain a mix of abstract (unimplemented) methods and concrete (implemented) methods. Abstract classes are used as a way to provide a common base for multiple classes that share some common behavior but also have variations in their behavior.

Key points about abstract classes:

1. **Abstract Methods:** Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods. Abstract methods are declared without an implementation and must be implemented by concrete subclasses.

2. **Cannot Be Instantiated:** You cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly. Instead, you must create subclasses that extend the abstract class and provide implementations for its abstract methods.

3. **Constructor:** Abstract classes can have constructors, which are used to initialize fields and set up the initial state of subclasses.

4. **Single Inheritance:** Java supports single inheritance for classes. A class can extend only one other class (abstract or concrete).

Example of an abstract class in Java:

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    private String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract void makeSound();  // Abstract method

    public void eat() {  // Concrete method
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Animal` is an abstract class with an abstract method `makeSound()` that must be implemented by subclasses. Subclasses can also inherit and use the concrete method `eat()`.

## Object-oriented design principles (SOLID)

SOLID is an acronym representing a set of five object-oriented design principles that are intended to guide software developers in creating well-structured and maintainable code. These principles are fundamental to writing clean, extensible, and scalable software. Let's explore each of the SOLID principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
   - In other words, a class should encapsulate a single, well-defined functionality or behavior.
   - This principle promotes maintainability by reducing the impact of changes and making code easier to understand.

2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - In practice, this means that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without altering existing code.
   - The OCP promotes code reusability and minimizes the risk of introducing new bugs when extending a system.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
   - In essence, if a class is a subtype of another class, it should be able to replace its parent class in a program without causing unexpected behavior or violating invariants.
   - The LSP ensures that derived classes adhere to the contract defined by their base classes.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - This principle encourages the creation of fine-grained and specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.
   - It helps reduce the coupling between components and makes it easier to create classes that implement only the methods they need.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).
   - Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
   - This principle promotes decoupling and flexibility by allowing for the easy replacement of low-level components with minimal impact on high-level components.

## Packages and namespaces


## **Packages (Java):**

In Java, a package is a way to group related classes and interfaces together. Packages help in organizing code, preventing naming conflicts, and providing a hierarchical structure to your application. Java uses a directory-like structure for packages. Classes in the same package can access each other without requiring explicit imports.

Key points about Java packages:

- **Hierarchy:** Packages can be organized in a hierarchical manner. For example, `com.example.myapp` is a package that contains subpackages like `com.example.myapp.data` and `com.example.myapp.ui`.

- **Access Control:** Classes and interfaces within a package can have package-private (default), `public`, `protected`, or `private` access modifiers to control their visibility.

- **Import Statements:** Classes from other packages can be accessed using import statements, which make those classes available for use in your code.

- **Conventions:** Java follows naming conventions, where packages are named using reverse domain names (e.g., `com.example.myapp`). This minimizes naming conflicts.

Example of using Java packages:

```java
package com.example.myapp.data;

public class DataProcessor {
    // Code for data processing
}
```

### **Namespaces (C# and .NET):**

In C# and the .NET framework, namespaces are used to organize related classes, structures, and other types. Namespaces serve a similar purpose as Java packages, providing a way to avoid naming collisions, improve code organization, and create a logical structure.

Key points about C# namespaces:

- **Flat Structure:** Unlike Java's hierarchical package structure, C# uses a flat namespace structure. Namespaces are used for organization but do not have a directory-like hierarchy.

- **Access Control:** Classes and types within a namespace can have access modifiers like `public`, `internal`, `protected`, and `private`.

- **Using Directives:** In C#, you use `using` directives to import namespaces and make their types accessible within a specific code file.

Example of using C# namespaces:

```csharp
namespace MyApp.Data
{
    public class DataProcessor
    {
        // Code for data processing
    }
}
```

**Differences:**

1. **Language-Specific:** Packages are used in Java, while namespaces are used in C# and .NET.

2. **Hierarchy:** Java packages support a hierarchical structure, while C# namespaces are flat.

3. **Access Modifiers:** Both packages and namespaces allow access control, but the naming and behavior of access modifiers may vary between languages.

4. **Import/Using:** In Java, you use import statements to access classes from other packages. In C#, you use `using` directives for the same purpose.

While the specific terminology and structure differ between packages and namespaces, both serve the common goal of organizing and structuring code to make it more maintainable, prevent naming conflicts, and improve code clarity and readability.

## Composition and aggregation

### **Composition:**

Composition is a strong "whole-part" relationship between two classes, where one class (the whole) is composed of one or more instances of another class (the part). In a composition relationship, the part object cannot exist independently of the whole object. If the whole object is destroyed, its part objects are typically destroyed with it. Composition is often used when a part is an essential component of the whole.

Key characteristics of composition:

1. **Strong Relationship:** Composition implies a strong, tightly coupled relationship between the whole and its parts.

2. **Lifetime Dependency:** The lifetime of the part objects is dependent on the lifetime of the whole object. When the whole object is created or destroyed, it affects the part objects.

3. **No Reuse:** The part objects are typically not meant to be reused in other contexts, as they are specifically designed for the whole object.

Example of composition in Java:

```java
class Engine {
    // Engine-specific properties and methods
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        engine = new Engine(); // Composition
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Car` class is composed of an `Engine` object. The `Engine` cannot exist independently of the `Car`, and its creation and destruction are tied to the `Car`.

### **Aggregation:**

Aggregation is a "whole-part" relationship between two classes, similar to composition. However, in aggregation, the part object can exist independently of the whole. Aggregation represents a weaker, looser relationship compared to composition. If the whole object is destroyed, its part objects remain unaffected and can exist in other contexts.

Key characteristics of aggregation:

1. **Weaker Relationship:** Aggregation implies a weaker, more loosely coupled relationship between the whole and its parts.

2. **Lifetime Independence:** The part objects can exist independently of the whole object. Their creation and destruction are not tied to the whole object.

3. **Potential for Reuse:** Part objects are designed to be reused in other contexts, as they can exist independently.

Example of aggregation in Java:

```java
class Student {
    // Student-specific properties and methods
}

class Classroom {
    private List<Student> students;

    public Classroom() {
        students = new ArrayList<>(); // Aggregation
    }

    public void addStudent(Student student) {
        students.add(student);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Classroom` class aggregates `Student` objects. Students can exist independently of a classroom, and they can be added to or removed from different classrooms.
