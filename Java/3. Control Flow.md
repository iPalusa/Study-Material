# 3. Control Flow

## Conditional statements
Conditional statements in Java allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. The three primary conditional statements in Java are `if`, `else if`, and `switch`. Here's an explanation of each:

1. **if Statement:**
   The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

   ```java
   if (condition) {
       // Code to be executed if the condition is true
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```java
   int age = 25;
   if (age >= 18) {
       System.out.println("You are an adult.");
   }
   ```

2. **else if Statement:**
   The `else if` statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. It is used when you have several conditions, and you want to execute different code blocks depending on which condition is true. The conditions are evaluated from top to bottom, and the first true condition's associated code block is executed.

   ```java
   if (condition1) {
       // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
   } else if (condition2) {
       // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
   } else {
       // Code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```java
   int score = 85;
   if (score >= 90) {
       System.out.println("You got an A.");
   } else if (score >= 80) {
       System.out.println("You got a B.");
   } else {
       System.out.println("You got a C or below.");
   }
   ```

3. **switch Statement:**
   The `switch` statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed. It's typically used when you have multiple cases to consider based on the value of a single expression.

   ```java
   switch (expression) {
       case value1:
           // Code to be executed if expression matches value1
           break;
       case value2:
           // Code to be executed if expression matches value2
           break;
       // ...
       default:
           // Code to be executed if no cases match the expression
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```java
   int dayOfWeek = 2;
   switch (dayOfWeek) {
       case 1:
           System.out.println("It's Monday.");
           break;
       case 2:
           System.out.println("It's Tuesday.");
           break;
       // ...
       default:
           System.out.println("It's an unknown day.");
   }
   ```

   Note that you should use the `break` statement to exit the `switch` block after each case. Otherwise, the program will continue executing subsequent cases until it encounters a `break`.

## Loops

Loops in Java are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, making it easier to perform repetitive tasks, process collections of data, and iterate through sequences. Java provides several types of loops, including `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. Here's an overview of each:

1. **for Loop:**
   The `for` loop is commonly used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and update.

   ```java
   for (initialization; condition; update) {
       // Code to be executed in each iteration
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       System.out.println("Iteration " + i);
   }
   ```

   In this example, the loop initializes `i` to 0, repeats as long as `i` is less than 5, and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

2. **while Loop:**
   The `while` loop is used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a specific condition is true. It checks the condition before entering the loop.

   ```java
   while (condition) {
       // Code to be executed while the condition is true
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```java
   int count = 0;
   while (count < 3) {
       System.out.println("Count: " + count);
       count++;
   }
   ```

   This loop continues executing as long as the `count` is less than 3.

3. **do-while Loop:**
   The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it checks the condition after executing the loop's code block. This guarantees that the block will execute at least once.

   ```java
   do {
       // Code to be executed at least once
   } while (condition);
   ```

   Example:

   ```java
   int number;
   do {
       System.out.print("Enter a positive number: ");
       number = scanner.nextInt();
   } while (number <= 0);
   ```

   In this example, the code inside the loop prompts the user to enter a positive number and continues doing so until a positive number is provided.

4. **Enhanced for Loop (for-each Loop):**
   The enhanced `for` loop is specifically designed for iterating through collections like arrays and lists. It simplifies the process of iterating through elements in a collection.

   ```java
   for (dataType element : collection) {
       // Code to process each element
   }
   ```

   Example:

   ```java
   String[] fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"};
   for (String fruit : fruits) {
       System.out.println(fruit);
   }
   ```

   This loop iterates through the elements of the `fruits` array and prints each fruit.

Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing data in your Java programs. Depending on your requirements, you can choose the loop type that best fits the situation. Each loop type has its own strengths and use cases.

## Break and continue statements

In Java, the `break` and `continue` statements are control flow statements that allow you to alter the normal flow of execution in loops (e.g., `for`, `while`, `do-while`) and switch statements. These statements provide ways to exit a loop prematurely (`break`) or skip the current iteration and continue with the next one (`continue`). Here's an explanation of each:

1. **break Statement:**
   - The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.
   - It is often used to terminate the loop early, even if the loop's condition is still true.

   Example of using `break` in a `for` loop:

   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
       if (i == 5) {
           break; // Exit the loop when i is 5
       }
       System.out.println("Iteration " + i);
   }
   ```

   In this example, the loop will terminate when `i` equals 5, and the program will not continue with iterations 6 to 10.

2. **continue Statement:**
   - The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration.
   - It is often used when you want to skip specific elements or conditions within a loop.

   Example of using `continue` in a `for` loop:

   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
       if (i % 2 == 0) {
           continue; // Skip even numbers
       }
       System.out.println("Odd number: " + i);
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `continue` statement skips even numbers (i.e., `i` % 2 == 0) and continues with the next iteration.

3. **Using break and continue in Nested Loops:**
   You can use `break` and `continue` in nested loops to control the flow within multiple levels of looping constructs. For example, you can use `break` to exit both the inner and outer loops or `continue` to skip specific iterations within nested loops.

   Example of using `break` in a nested loop:

   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
       for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
           if (i * j > 4) {
               break; // Exit both loops when i * j is greater than 4
           }
           System.out.println("i * j = " + (i * j));
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `break` statement exits both the inner and outer loops when the condition is met.

   Example of using `continue` in a nested loop:

   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
       for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
           if (i == 2 && j == 2) {
               continue; // Skip the iteration when i is 2 and j is 2
           }
           System.out.println("i, j = " + i + ", " + j);
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `continue` statement skips the iteration when `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, resulting in the numbers 2, 2 being skipped.

Both `break` and `continue` are valuable tools for controlling the flow of your loops and allowing you to handle specific conditions or exit loops when necessary.

## Exception handling

Exception handling in Java is a mechanism for dealing with runtime errors, also known as exceptions. Java provides a robust system for handling exceptions, allowing you to gracefully manage errors and prevent your program from crashing. Key components of exception handling include `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, and `finally`. Here's an overview of each:

1. **try and catch Blocks:**
   - The `try` block contains the code that may throw an exception.
   - The `catch` block(s) follow the `try` block and handle specific types of exceptions. Multiple `catch` blocks can be used to catch different exception types.
   - When an exception is thrown inside the `try` block, the corresponding `catch` block(s) are checked to see if they can handle the exception.

   Example:

   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw an exception
       int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw an ArithmeticException
   } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
       // Handle the exception
       System.out.println("An ArithmeticException occurred: " + e.getMessage());
   } catch (Exception e) {
       // Catch more general exceptions (optional)
       System.out.println("A general exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
   }
   ```

2. **throw Statement:**
   - The `throw` statement is used to explicitly throw an exception in your code.
   - You can throw exceptions of a specific type, such as a custom exception class that extends `Exception` or one of Java's built-in exceptions.

   Example:

   ```java
   public void checkAge(int age) throws AgeException {
       if (age < 0) {
           throw new AgeException("Age cannot be negative");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **throws Clause:**
   - The `throws` clause is used in method signatures to indicate that the method may throw a specific type of exception.
   - It informs callers of the method that they should handle or propagate the exceptions.

   Example:

   ```java
   public void doSomething() throws MyException {
       // Code that may throw MyException
   }
   ```

4. **finally Block:**
   - The `finally` block is used to specify code that must be executed whether an exception is thrown or not. It's often used for cleanup tasks, such as closing resources like files or database connections.
   - The `finally` block is executed after the `try` block and any relevant `catch` block(s).

   Example:

   ```java
   FileInputStream file = null;
   try {
       file = new FileInputStream("myfile.txt");
       // Code to read from the file
   } catch (IOException e) {
       System.out.println("An IOException occurred: " + e.getMessage());
   } finally {
       // Close the file, even if an exception occurs
       if (file != null) {
           try {
               file.close();
           } catch (IOException e) {
               System.out.println("Failed to close the file: " + e.getMessage());
           }
       }
   }
   ```

Exception handling in Java is essential for writing reliable and robust applications. It allows you to gracefully handle errors and recover from exceptional situations. By using `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, and `finally`, you can build more resilient software and provide meaningful feedback to users when errors occur.

## Iterators and foreach loop

Iterators and for-each loops are used in Java to iterate through collections and arrays. They provide a convenient way to traverse the elements within a data structure and process each element one at a time. Here's a brief overview of iterators and for-each loops:

### **Iterators:**

1. **What are Iterators?**
   - An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse elements within a collection, such as ArrayLists, Sets, and Maps.
   - It provides methods like `hasNext()` to check if there are more elements, and `next()` to access the next element in the collection.

2. **Iterator Example:**
   ```java
   List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
   names.add("Alice");
   names.add("Bob");
   names.add("Charlie");
   
   Iterator<String> iterator = names.iterator();
   while (iterator.hasNext()) {
       String name = iterator.next();
       // Process 'name'
   }
   ```

3. **Iterators and Data Structures:**
   - Different data structures provide different types of iterators. For example, ArrayLists have `ListIterator`, while Sets have `Iterator`.

4. **Removing Elements with Iterators:**
   - Iterators often provide a `remove()` method to safely remove elements from a collection while iterating.

### **For-Each Loops (Enhanced for Loops):**

1. **What are For-Each Loops?**
   - A for-each loop is a more concise and readable way to iterate through arrays and collections, introduced in Java 5.
   - It works with any data structure that implements the `Iterable` interface, such as ArrayLists, Sets, arrays, and more.

2. **For-Each Loop Example:**
   ```java
   List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
   names.add("Alice");
   names.add("Bob");
   names.add("Charlie");
   
   for (String name : names) {
       // Process 'name'
   }
   ```

3. **Simplified Syntax:**
   - For-each loops hide the details of iterators, making code shorter and more readable.

4. **Read-Only:**
   - For-each loops are generally used for read-only access to elements. They don't provide the ability to modify the collection during iteration.

**When to Use Each:**

- Use iterators when you need to modify the collection while iterating or when working with data structures that don't support for-each loops (e.g., Maps).
- Use for-each loops for simple iteration over collections or arrays, especially when the primary goal is to process each element and you don't need to remove or modify them.
