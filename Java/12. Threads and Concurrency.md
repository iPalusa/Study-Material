# 12. Threads and Concurrency

## Introduction to multi-threading
Introduction to multi-threading is the starting point for understanding concurrent programming and how it works in Java. Multithreading allows a program to execute multiple threads simultaneously, enabling better resource utilization and improved responsiveness. Here's a basic overview:

**What is Multi-Threading?**
- Multithreading is a technique in which multiple threads run in a single process to perform multiple tasks concurrently.
- Threads are the smallest units of execution in a program, and they can run independently.

**Why Use Multi-Threading?**
- **Improved Performance:** Multithreading can utilize multiple CPU cores, which can lead to improved performance and faster execution of tasks.
- **Responsiveness:** Multithreading can help keep a program responsive by allowing certain tasks (e.g., user interface updates) to run in the background without blocking the main thread.
- **Resource Utilization:** Multithreading is efficient in terms of resource utilization as it allows the sharing of resources among multiple threads.

**Threads in Java:**
- Java supports multithreading through the use of the `Thread` class.
- You can create threads by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.
- Example of creating and starting a thread in Java:

```java
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in this thread
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
        thread1.start();
    }
}
```

**Thread States:**
- Threads go through various states during their lifecycle, including `NEW`, `RUNNABLE`, `BLOCKED`, `WAITING`, `TIMED_WAITING`, and `TERMINATED`.
- Understanding these states is essential for managing and debugging concurrent programs.

**Challenges of Multi-Threading:**
- **Synchronization:** When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization mechanisms are required to avoid data races and ensure thread safety.
- **Deadlocks:** Deadlocks occur when two or more threads block each other and cannot make progress.
- **Race Conditions:** Race conditions can lead to unpredictable behavior and bugs in multithreaded programs.

**Thread Priorities:**
- Threads can have priorities ranging from `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` to `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY`.
- Priorities affect the order in which threads are scheduled to run, but they don't guarantee precise execution order.

**Daemon Threads:**
- Daemon threads are threads that run in the background to perform tasks such as garbage collection.
- They don't prevent the JVM from exiting when all non-daemon threads have finished.

**Summary:**
Understanding the basics of multithreading is crucial for developing concurrent applications in Java. It allows you to harness the power of modern processors and create more responsive and efficient programs. However, it also introduces challenges, such as synchronization and managing shared resources, which need to be addressed to write robust and reliable multithreaded code.

## Creating and managing threads

1. **Extending Thread Class**
   - Extend the `Thread` class and override the `run` method.
   - Example:
     ```java
     class MyThread extends Thread {
         public void run() {
             // Thread logic here
         }
     }
     MyThread thread = new MyThread();
     thread.start();
     ```

2. **Implementing Runnable Interface**
   - Implement the `Runnable` interface and override the `run` method.
   - Example:
     ```java
     class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
         public void run() {
             // Thread logic here
         }
     }
     Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
     thread.start();
     ```

3. **Anonymous Inner Class**
   - Use an anonymous inner class to define and start a thread.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
         public void run() {
             // Thread logic here
         }
     });
     thread.start();
     ```

4. **Using Lambda Expressions (Java 8+)**
   - Utilize lambda expressions for concise thread creation.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
         // Thread logic here
     });
     thread.start();
     ```

5. **Thread Pool (Executor)**
   - Use thread pools to manage and reuse threads efficiently.
   - Example:
     ```java
     ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
     executor.execute(() -> {
         // Thread logic here
     });
     executor.shutdown();
     ```

Remember that when starting a thread, you call the `start` method to initiate its execution, not `run`. Using thread pools can help manage and reuse threads for improved concurrency and resource utilization.

## **Synchronization and thread safety**

1. **Synchronized Methods:**
   - **Explanation:** Marking a method as `synchronized` ensures that only one thread can execute it at a time, preventing concurrent access to shared resources.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
         // Thread-safe code here
     }
     ```

2. **Synchronized Blocks:**
   - **Explanation:** Using synchronized blocks with an object's monitor to protect critical sections of code, reducing contention.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     Object lock = new Object();
     synchronized (lock) {
         // Thread-safe code here
     }
     ```

3. **Volatile Keyword:**
   - **Explanation:** Declaring a variable as `volatile` ensures that reads and writes to it are visible to all threads, providing a basic form of thread safety.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     private volatile boolean flag = false;
     ```

4. **java.util.concurrent Locks:**
   - **Explanation:** Using locks like `ReentrantLock` to create fine-grained control over synchronization and condition variables for more complex synchronization scenarios.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
     lock.lock();
     try {
         // Thread-safe code here
     } finally {
         lock.unlock();
     }
     ```

5. **Atomic Classes:**
   - **Explanation:** Utilizing atomic classes like `AtomicInteger` for thread-safe operations without explicit locking.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
     count.incrementAndGet();
     ```

6. **Concurrent Collections:**
   - **Explanation:** Using concurrent collections like `ConcurrentHashMap` to allow concurrent access with thread safety built-in.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
     map.put("key", 42);
     ```

Remember that the choice of synchronization method depends on the specific use case and performance requirements. Each method provides a different level of control and efficiency for thread safety in Java.

## Thread communication and coordination

1. **Synchronized Blocks and Methods:**
   - Use `synchronized` keyword to control access to shared resources.
   - Example: Protecting a critical section with synchronized method:
     ```java
     public synchronized void criticalSection() {
         // Access shared resource safely
     }
     ```

2. **Wait and Notify:**
   - Use `wait()` to make a thread wait for a condition and `notify()` to signal that the condition is met.
   - Example: Producer-consumer pattern using `wait` and `notify`:
     ```java
     synchronized (sharedQueue) {
         while (sharedQueue.isEmpty()) {
             sharedQueue.wait(); // Wait for items to be produced
         }
         // Consume item
         sharedQueue.notify(); // Notify producer
     }
     ```

3. **CountDownLatch:**
   - A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations is performed.
   - Example: Wait for multiple tasks to complete using `CountDownLatch`:
     ```java
     CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);
     // In each task, call latch.countDown() when done
     latch.await(); // Wait for all tasks to finish
     ```

4. **CyclicBarrier:**
   - A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to wait for each other at a predefined point.
   - Example: Synchronize multiple threads at a barrier point:
     ```java
     CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(4);
     // In each thread, call barrier.await() to synchronize
     ```

5. **Semaphore:**
   - Controls the number of threads that can access a resource simultaneously.
   - Example: Semaphore limiting concurrent access to a resource:
     ```java
     Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(2); // Allow 2 threads at a time
     semaphore.acquire(); // Acquire a permit
     // Access resource
     semaphore.release(); // Release permit
     ```

These techniques facilitate communication and coordination between threads, enabling synchronized execution and orderly handling of shared resources and tasks.
