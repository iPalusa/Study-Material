# 2. Variables, data types, and operators

In Java, variables, data types, and operators are fundamental concepts that allow you to work with and manipulate data in your programs. Let's explore each of these concepts in more detail:

1. **Variables:**
   - Variables are used to store and manage data in your Java programs.
   - To declare a variable, you specify its data type and a name. For example:
   
     ```java
     int age; // Declaring an integer variable named 'age'
     ```

   - You can also assign a value to a variable during declaration:

     ```java
     double pi = 3.14159; // Declaring and initializing a double variable 'pi'
     ```

   - Variables must be declared before they are used, and they have a scope within which they are accessible.

2. **Data Types:**
   - Java has two categories of data types: primitive data types and reference data types.
   - **Primitive Data Types:** These are basic data types provided by the Java language. They include:
     - `int`: Integer data type (e.g., 42)
     - `double`: Double-precision floating-point data type (e.g., 3.14)
     - `boolean`: Boolean data type (true or false)
     - `char`: Character data type (e.g., 'A')
     - `byte`, `short`, `long`, and `float`: Other numeric data types
   - **Reference Data Types:** These include:
     - Objects
     - Arrays
     - Custom classes

3. **Operators:**
   - Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Java provides various types of operators, including:

   - **Arithmetic Operators:**
     - `+` (Addition)
     - `-` (Subtraction)
     - `*` (Multiplication)
     - `/` (Division)
     - `%` (Modulus, for finding the remainder)

   - **Relational Operators:**
     - `==` (Equal to)
     - `!=` (Not equal to)
     - `<` (Less than)
     - `>` (Greater than)
     - `<=` (Less than or equal to)
     - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)

   - **Logical Operators:**
     - `&&` (Logical AND)
     - `||` (Logical OR)
     - `!` (Logical NOT)

   - **Assignment Operators:**
     - `=` (Assignment)
     - `+=` (Add and assign)
     - `-=` (Subtract and assign)
     - `*=` (Multiply and assign)
     - `/=` (Divide and assign)
     - `%=` (Modulus and assign)

   - **Increment/Decrement Operators:**
     - `++` (Increment by 1)
     - `--` (Decrement by 1)
     - These can be used as either prefix (++i) or postfix (i++) operators.

   - **Bitwise Operators:**
     - `&` (Bitwise AND)
     - `|` (Bitwise OR)
     - `^` (Bitwise XOR)
     - `~` (Bitwise NOT)
     - `<<` (Left shift)
     - `>>` (Right shift)
     - `>>>` (Unsigned right shift)

   - **Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator):**
     - `condition ? true-expression : false-expression`
     - Used for conditional assignment.

   - **Instanceof Operator:**
     - `object instanceof ClassName`
     - Used to test if an object is an instance of a particular class or interface.

Here's an example that combines variables, data types, and operators:

```java
public class VariablesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        int y = 3;
        int sum = x + y;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);

        double average = (double) sum / 2; // Casting to double before division
        System.out.println("Average: " + average);

        boolean isGreater = x > y;
        System.out.println("Is x greater than y? " + isGreater);
    }
}
```

In this example, we declare and initialize variables, perform arithmetic operations, and use a relational operator to make a comparison. The result is printed to the console.
