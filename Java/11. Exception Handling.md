# 11. Exception Handling

## Introduction to Exceptions

### **What is Exceptions?**

Exceptions are unexpected or exceptional events that can occur during the execution of a program. They disrupt the normal flow of a program and can be caused by various factors such as incorrect input, unavailable resources, or unexpected conditions. In Java and many other programming languages, exceptions are used to handle and manage these abnormal situations. Exceptions are objects that encapsulate information about the error or exceptional condition and can be caught and handled by the program to ensure that it doesn't crash or produce incorrect results. Exception handling allows developers to gracefully respond to errors, log them, and take appropriate actions to maintain the program's stability and reliability.

### **Types of Exceptions**
**Checked Exceptions:**

1. **Definition:** Checked exceptions are exceptions that the Java compiler mandates to be either handled using `try-catch` blocks or declared with a `throws` clause in the method signature.

2. **Example:** `IOException` is a checked exception, typically encountered when working with files. To read a file, you must handle or declare it:
   
   ```java
   public void readFile() throws IOException {
       // Code that reads a file
   }
   ```
    ```java
    try {
        // Code that may throw a checked exception
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle or log the exception
    }
    ```

**Unchecked Exceptions:**

1. **Definition:** Unchecked exceptions (runtime exceptions) are exceptions that do not need to be declared or caught explicitly and typically represent programming errors or unexpected conditions.

2. **Example:** `ArithmeticException` is an unchecked exception, often triggered by division by zero:

   ```java
   int result = 10 / 0; // Causes an ArithmeticException at runtime
   ```
    ```java
    // No need to catch or declare unchecked exceptions.
    int[] arr = null;
    int value = arr[0]; // Throws NullPointerException.
    ```

### **The Exception Hierarchy (Throwable, Error, Exception)**

1. **Throwable Class**:
   - `getMessage()`: Returns the detail message of the Throwable object.
   - Example: 
     ```java
     try {
         // Code that may throw an exception
     } catch (Throwable t) {
         System.out.println(t.getMessage());
     }
     ```

2. **Error Class**:
   - `OutOfMemoryError`: Indicates a memory shortage.
   - Example:
     ```java
     try {
         throw new OutOfMemoryError("Memory exhausted.");
     } catch (Error e) {
         System.out.println(e.getMessage());
     }
     ```

3. **Exception Class**:
   - `IOException`: Represents an I/O exception.
   - Example:
     ```java
     try {
         throw new IOException("Input/output error.");
     } catch (Exception e) {
         System.out.println(e.getMessage());
     }
     ```

The `Throwable` class is the root of the Java exception hierarchy, and it has a `getMessage()` method to retrieve an error message. `Error` and `Exception` are subclasses of `Throwable`, where `Error` is typically used for serious system-level errors, and `Exception` is used for recoverable exceptions, including checked and unchecked exceptions. Each of these classes can have various subclasses with their own specialized exceptions.

### Custom Exceptions

Custom exceptions allow you to define your own exception types in Java to handle specific errors gracefully. Here's a cheat sheet with explanations and examples:

1. **Creating a Custom Exception Class:**
   ```java
   public class CustomException extends Exception {
       public CustomException(String message) {
           super(message);
       }
   }
   ```
   - Define a custom exception class that extends `Exception`.

2. **Throwing a Custom Exception:**
   ```java
   if (someConditionIsMet) {
       throw new CustomException("This is a custom exception message.");
   }
   ```
   - Use the `throw` keyword to raise your custom exception when a specific condition is met.

3. **Catching and Handling Custom Exceptions:**
   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw CustomException
   } catch (CustomException e) {
       System.out.println("Custom Exception Caught: " + e.getMessage());
   }
   ```
   - Use a `try-catch` block to catch and handle your custom exception when it's thrown.


## Handling Exceptions

### **Using `try`, `catch`, `finally` Blocks**:

1. **try Block**: Encloses code that might throw an exception.
   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may cause an exception
   }
   ```

2. **catch Block**: Handles exceptions that occur in the try block.
   ```java
   catch (ExceptionType e) {
       // Handle the exception
   }
   ```

3. **finally Block**: Optional block that always executes, with or without an exception.
   ```java
   finally {
       // Cleanup or finalization code
   }
   ```

**Example:**

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw an ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.err.println("Division by zero: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    System.out.println("Finally block always executed.");
}
```

In this example, the `try` block attempts a division by zero, which triggers an `ArithmeticException`. The `catch` block handles the exception, and the `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, making it suitable for cleanup or finalization tasks.

### **Exception Propagation**

1. **Propagating Checked Exceptions:**
   - Declaring exceptions in a method's signature.
   - Example:
     ```java
     void methodA() throws IOException {
       // Code that may throw IOException
     }
     ```

2. **Propagating Unchecked Exceptions:**
   - Not declaring exceptions in the method's signature.
   - Example:
     ```java
     void methodB() {
       // Code that may throw NullPointerException
     }
     ```

3. **Catching and Propagating:**
   - Catching an exception and rethrowing it.
   - Example:
     ```java
     void methodC() {
       try {
         // Code that may throw SQLException
       } catch (SQLException e) {
         // Log or handle the exception
         throw e; // Rethrow the exception
       }
     }
     ```
     
In the last example, `methodC` catches an exception and then rethrows it, allowing it to propagate up the call stack.

### **Rethrowing Exceptions**

**What:** Rethrowing an exception allows you to propagate an exception up the call stack while maintaining the original exception type and details.

**How:** 
1. Catch the exception using a `catch` block.
2. Use the `throw` statement to rethrow the caught exception.
3. The caller method can handle or rethrow the exception again.

**Example:**
```java
public void doSomething() throws MyException {
    try {
        // Code that may throw an exception
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle or rethrow the exception
        throw new MyException("Custom message", e);
    }
}
```

In the example, `MyException` is rethrown with additional context, allowing higher-level methods to handle or rethrow it.

### **Multiple catch Blocks**

Multiple `catch` blocks allow you to handle different types of exceptions in a Java method.

1. **Using Multiple `catch` Blocks:**
   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw exceptions
   } catch (IOException e) {
       // Handle IOException
   } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
       // Handle NumberFormatException
   }
   ```

2. **Order Matters:**
   Catch blocks are evaluated from top to bottom, so place more specific exception types before more general ones. 

3. **Multiple Exceptions in a Single `catch` Block (Java 7+):**
   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw exceptions
   } catch (IOException | NumberFormatException e) {
       // Handle both IOException and NumberFormatException
   }
   ```

By using multiple `catch` blocks, you can tailor your exception handling to different error scenarios within a method, providing more specific responses for different exception types.

### **Catching and Handling Specific Exception Types**

1. **Catch a Specific Exception**
   - Syntax: `try { ... } catch (SpecificExceptionType e) { ... }`
   - Example:
     ```java
     try {
         // Code that may throw a FileNotFoundException
     } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
         // Handle the FileNotFoundException
     }
     ```

2. **Catch Multiple Exception Types**
   - Syntax: `try { ... } catch (ExceptionType1 | ExceptionType2 e) { ... }`
   - Example:
     ```java
     try {
         // Code that may throw an IOException or a SQLException
     } catch (IOException | SQLException e) {
         // Handle the exception
     }
     ```

3. **Catch and Re-throw Exception**
   - Syntax: `try { ... } catch (SpecificExceptionType e) { throw e; }`
   - Example:
     ```java
     try {
         // Code that may throw a SpecificException
     } catch (SpecificException e) {
         // Handle the exception locally, then re-throw it
         throw e;
     }
     ```

Catching specific exception types allows you to handle different exceptions differently and provides more control over your error-handling logic.

### **The `finally` Block**

The `finally` block is used to execute code that must run regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. It's typically used for resource cleanup.

Example:
```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Exception handling
} finally {
    // Code that always runs
}
```

In the example, the code in the `finally` block will execute even if an exception is thrown in the `try` block. This is useful for releasing resources or performing cleanup tasks.

### **Using `try-with-resources` for Resource Cleanup**



Example 1: Reading a Text File

```java
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        // Process the file content
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Example 2: Writing to a Text File

```java
try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {
    String text = "This is a line of text.";
    writer.write(text);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Example 3: Working with Streams

```java
try (InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
     OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.txt")) {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    int bytesRead;
    while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
        outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Explanation:
- `try-with-resources` automatically closes the specified resources (e.g., files, streams) when the block is exited or when exceptions occur, ensuring proper resource cleanup.
- In the examples, the code reads or writes files and closes the resources (e.g., `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`) without the need for explicit `close()` calls.
- `IOException` is caught for error handling.

## Advanced Exception Handling

### **Chained Exceptions (Exception Chaining)**

**Method**: `initCause(Throwable cause)`
- Sets the cause of this exception, creating a chained exception. Returns the exception itself.

**Usage**: Useful for providing a higher-level context when rethrowing an exception.

**Example**:
```java
try {
    // Some code that may throw an exception
} catch (IOException e) {
    RuntimeException customException = new RuntimeException("Custom message");
    customException.initCause(e);
    throw customException;
}
```

In this example, we catch an `IOException`, wrap it in a custom `RuntimeException`, and set the `IOException` as the cause using `initCause`. This provides more information about the root cause of the exception. 

### **Using throws and throw Keywords**

**Using `throws` Keyword:**

1. **`throws` Keyword**: Used in a method signature to declare checked exceptions that the method may throw.

   Example:
   ```java
   public void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
       // Method code that may throw an IOException
   }
   ```

**Using `throw` Keyword:**

1. **`throw` Keyword**: Used to explicitly throw an exception within a method.

   Example:
   ```java
   public void divide(int numerator, int denominator) {
       if (denominator == 0) {
           throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero is not allowed.");
       }
       int result = numerator / denominator;
   }
   ```

The `throws` keyword is used to declare that a method can throw checked exceptions, which must be caught or declared in calling code. The `throw` keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly when a specific condition is met in the method.

### **Global Exception Handling (Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler)**


1. **`Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler`**
   - Set a global exception handler for uncaught exceptions in Java threads.

   ```java
   Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler((thread, exception) -> {
       System.err.println("Uncaught exception in thread " + thread.getName() + ": " + exception.getMessage());
   });
   ```

2. **`Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler`**
   - Interface for handling uncaught exceptions. Implement this interface to define custom exception handling behavior.

   ```java
   Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler customHandler = (thread, exception) -> {
       // Custom handling logic
   };
   ```

3. **Usage**
   - This global handler is invoked when an uncaught exception occurs in any thread, providing a central point for custom exception handling.

   ```java
   Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(customHandler);
   ```

Global exception handling can be useful for logging and taking specific actions when uncaught exceptions occur in Java threads, making it easier to identify and manage errors in your applications.
