# 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)


OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a programming paradigm or a way of organizing and designing software using the concept of "objects." OOP is based on several key principles and concepts that make it easier to model real-world entities and their interactions in software.

OOP provides several benefits, including code reusability, modularity, maintainability, and improved organization of software. It is widely used in software development for building complex and large-scale applications, as it encourages a structured and object-centered approach to problem-solving.

## **Classes:**
- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects of that type.
- Classes are used to encapsulate data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) related to a specific entity or concept.
- In Java, you define a class using the `class` keyword.

Here's a simple example of a Java class representing a "Person":

```java
public class Person {
    // Fields (attributes)
    String name;
    int age;

    // Constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Method
    public void introduce() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I am " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` class has fields (name and age), a constructor, and a method (introduce).

## **Objects:**
- An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific real-world entity or concept based on the class blueprint.
- Objects have attributes (field values) and can perform actions (invoke methods) defined in the class.
- You create objects by instantiating a class using the `new` keyword.

Here's how you can create and use objects based on the `Person` class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create two Person objects
        Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
        Person person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

        // Access fields and methods of the objects
        System.out.println(person1.name); // Access the name field
        person2.introduce(); // Call the introduce method for person2
    }
}
```

In this example, two `Person` objects (person1 and person2) are created, and their fields are accessed and methods are invoked.

### **Key Concepts:**
- Inheritance: Classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes, creating a hierarchy of classes.
- Encapsulation: Classes encapsulate data (fields) and behaviors (methods), providing a way to hide implementation details and protect data.
- Constructors: Constructors are special methods used to create and initialize objects of a class.
- Instantiation: The `new` keyword is used to create new instances of a class (i.e., objects).
- Member Access: You access fields and methods of an object using the dot notation (e.g., `object.field` or `object.method()`).

### **Object Methods:**


**1. `equals(Object obj)` Method:**
   - Used to compare the current object with another object for content equality.
   - Override this method to provide custom comparison logic for user-defined classes.

   ```java
   @Override
   public boolean equals(Object obj) {
       if (this == obj) {
           return true; // Objects are the same
       }
       if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
           return false; // Different classes or null object
       }
       // Custom comparison logic
       YourClass other = (YourClass) obj;
       return field1.equals(other.field1) && field2 == other.field2;
   }
   ```

**2. `hashCode()` Method:**
   - Returns a hash code value for the object, which is used for efficient storage and retrieval in hash-based data structures like `HashMap`.

   ```java
   @Override
   public int hashCode() {
       int result = field1.hashCode();
       result = 31 * result + field2;
       return result;
   }
   ```

**3. `toString()` Method:**
   - Returns a string representation of the object.
   - Override this method to provide a meaningful string representation for your class.

   ```java
   @Override
   public String toString() {
       return "YourClass{field1='" + field1 + "', field2=" + field2 + '}';
   }
   ```

**4. `clone()` Method:**
   - Used to create a copy of the object (shallow copy).
   - Implement `Cloneable` interface and override the `clone` method for your class.

   ```java
   @Override
   public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
       return super.clone();
   }
   ```

**5. `finalize()` Method:**
   - Called by the garbage collector when it determines no more references to the object.
   - Override this method if you need to perform cleanup operations before the object is reclaimed.

   ```java
   @Override
   protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
       // Cleanup operations
   }
   ```

**6. `compareTo(Object obj)` Method (for Comparable classes):**
   - Used to define a natural ordering of objects for sorting and comparisons.
   - Implement the `Comparable` interface and override the `compareTo` method.

   ```java
   @Override
   public int compareTo(YourClass other) {
       return this.field1.compareTo(other.field1);
   }
   ```

**7. `equals` and `hashCode` Example:**
   - A complete example demonstrating `equals` and `hashCode` methods for a `Person` class.

   ```java
   public class Person {
       private String name;
       private int age;

       // Constructors, getters, and setters here

       @Override
       public boolean equals(Object obj) {
           if (this == obj) return true;
           if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
           Person person = (Person) obj;
           return age == person.age &&
                  Objects.equals(name, person.name);
       }

       @Override
       public int hashCode() {
           return Objects.hash(name, age);
       }
   }
   ```

**8. `toString` Example:**
   - A `toString` method example for the `Person` class.

   ```java
   @Override
   public String toString() {
       return "Person{" +
               "name='" + name + '\'' +
               ", age=" + age +
               '}';
   }
   ```

## Constructors and methods

Constructors and methods are essential components of classes in object-oriented programming (OOP). They serve different purposes but are both crucial for defining the behavior and initialization of objects. Let's explore constructors and methods in more detail:

**Constructors:**
- Constructors are special methods in a class used to create and initialize objects when they are instantiated.
- Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.
- They are typically used to set initial values for object attributes (fields).
- Constructors can have parameters to accept values during object creation, allowing for customization of objects.
- If you don't define a constructor, a default (no-argument) constructor is provided by the compiler.
- Constructors can be overloaded, meaning you can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
- A parameterized constructor is a special type of constructor in object-oriented programming (OOP) that accepts one or more parameters or arguments during the creation of an object. These parameters are used to initialize the object's attributes (fields) with specific values when the object is instantiated. Parameterized constructors allow you to create more customized and flexible objects by providing initial values during object creation.

Here's an example of a class with constructors in Java:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // No-argument constructor (default)
    public Person() {
        name = "Unknown";
        age = 0;
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Other methods here
}
```

**Methods:**
- Methods in a class define the behavior and actions that objects of the class can perform.
- Methods have a name, return type (or `void` if they don't return a value), and parameters (if needed).
- You can have instance methods (associated with objects) and static methods (associated with the class itself).
- Methods can access and modify the object's attributes (fields) and perform various tasks.
- Methods can be called on objects using the dot notation (e.g., `objectName.methodName(arguments)`).

Here's an example of a class with methods in Java:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    public int subtract(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 - num2;
    }

    public void displayResult(int result) {
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Calculator` class has methods for addition, subtraction, and displaying results.

Constructors and methods work together to define the behavior and initial state of objects. Constructors are primarily used for object initialization, while methods define what objects can do. Together, they allow you to create reusable and well-organized classes for your object-oriented programs.

## Inheritance and polymorphism

### **Inheritance:**

Inheritance is a key OOP concept that allows you to create a new class (a subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (a superclass or base class). The subclass inherits the attributes (fields) and methods (behaviors) of the superclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse and allows you to model relationships between classes in a hierarchical manner.

Key points about inheritance:

1. **Superclass and Subclass:** The superclass is the class being extended, and the subclass is the class that extends the superclass.

2. **"is-a" Relationship:** Inheritance is used when a subclass "is-a" type of the superclass. For example, a `Cat` class can inherit from an `Animal` superclass because a cat is a type of animal.

3. **Access to Superclass Members:** The subclass can access public and protected members (fields and methods) of the superclass, but it cannot access private members.

4. **Method Overriding:** Subclasses can provide their own implementation for methods inherited from the superclass. This is known as method overriding and is a form of polymorphism.

Example of inheritance in Java:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("The animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("The cat meows.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cat myCat = new Cat();
        myCat.eat(); // Inherited method
        myCat.meow(); // Subclass method
    }
}
```

**Polymorphism:**

Polymorphism is another fundamental OOP concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects. Polymorphism allows you to write more generic and flexible code.

Key points about polymorphism:

1. **Method Overriding:** Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is declared in the superclass.

2. **"One Interface, Multiple Implementations":** Polymorphism allows you to interact with objects through a common interface (e.g., a superclass) while executing the specific behavior of the actual object (e.g., a subclass).

3. **Dynamic Binding:** In polymorphism, method calls are resolved at runtime based on the actual object type, not the reference type. This is known as dynamic binding or late binding.

Example of polymorphism in Java:

```java
class Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle();
        Shape square = new Square();

        circle.draw(); // Calls the draw method of the Circle class
        square.draw(); // Calls the draw method of the Square class
    }
}
```

In this example, polymorphism allows objects of different subclasses (`Circle` and `Square`) to be treated as objects of the common superclass (`Shape`) and still execute their specific implementations of the `draw` method.

## Encapsulation and access modifiers

Encapsulation and access modifiers are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that help in managing the visibility and accessibility of the internal components of a class, such as fields and methods. They contribute to the principle of data hiding and access control, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of an object's data.

### **Encapsulation:**

Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts (the others being inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction). It refers to the bundling of data (attributes or fields) and the methods (behaviors) that operate on that data into a single unit called an object. In essence, encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of how an object works and exposing only what is necessary for the outside world to interact with it. The primary goals of encapsulation are to:

1. Protect the integrity of the object's data by controlling access to it.
2. Provide a consistent and well-defined interface for interacting with the object.

Encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers (also called visibility modifiers) in the class definition to control the access to its fields and methods.

### **Access Modifiers:**

Access modifiers are keywords in object-oriented programming that specify the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields, methods, and nested classes). In Java, there are four main access modifiers:

1. **`public`:** Members with this modifier are accessible from any class.

2. **`private`:** Members with this modifier are only accessible within the same class. They are not visible to other classes.

3. **`protected`:** Members with this modifier are accessible within the same class, its subclasses, and classes in the same package.

4. **`default` (package-private):** Members with no explicit access modifier are considered "package-private" and are accessible only within the same package.

Here's how access modifiers and encapsulation work together:

- Public methods and fields are accessible from anywhere, making them part of the object's public interface.
- Private fields are only accessible within the class, ensuring that their values can be controlled and validated.
- Protected fields and methods are accessible within the class, its subclasses, and classes in the same package.
- Package-private (default) members are accessible within the same package, providing a degree of control within a package.

Example of encapsulation and access modifiers in Java:

```java
public class Car {
    private String make;       // Private field
    private int year;          // Private field

    public Car(String make, int year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void startEngine() {   // Public method
        // Start the engine logic
    }

    public String getMake() {     // Public method to access the 'make' field
        return make;
    }

    private void repair() {       // Private method
        // Repair the car logic
    }

    // Other methods and constructors here
}
```

In this example, the `Car` class demonstrates encapsulation by keeping the `make` and `year` fields private. Access to these fields is controlled through public methods like `getMake`, ensuring that the object's data is accessed and modified in a controlled manner. The `startEngine` method is accessible to the outside world, but the `repair` method is private and hidden from external access.

## Method overloading and overriding

Method overloading and method overriding are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming that involve defining and using methods in classes. They serve different purposes and are often used in different contexts. Let's explore these concepts in more detail:

**Method Overloading:**

Method overloading is a technique that allows you to define multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameter lists. These methods are distinguished by the number or types of their parameters. Method overloading is a form of compile-time (static) polymorphism, and it provides flexibility and convenience when working with methods.

Key points about method overloading:

1. **Same Method Name:** Overloaded methods have the same name but different parameter lists (i.e., different types or different numbers of parameters).

2. **Compile-Time Resolution:** The appropriate overloaded method to be executed is determined at compile time based on the method's signature (name and parameter types).

3. **Return Type:** The return type alone is not sufficient to differentiate overloaded methods.

Example of method overloading in Java:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    public double add(double num1, double num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    public int add(int num1, int num2, int num3) {
        return num1 + num2 + num3;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `add` method is overloaded with three different parameter lists to accommodate integers, doubles, and three integers.

**Method Overriding:**

Method overriding is a mechanism that allows a subclass to provide its own implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. In method overriding, the method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass. Method overriding is a form of runtime (dynamic) polymorphism, and it enables you to change the behavior of a method for a specific subclass.

Key points about method overriding:

1. **Same Method Signature:** Overriding methods have the same method name, return type, and parameter list as the method they are overriding from the superclass.

2. **Runtime Resolution:** The method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual object type, not the reference type.

3. **`@Override` Annotation:** It's a good practice to use the `@Override` annotation to indicate that a method is intended to be an override. This helps catch errors at compile time.

Example of method overriding in Java:

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `makeSound` method is overridden in the `Dog` class to provide a specific implementation. When you call `makeSound` on a `Dog` object, it executes the overridden method in the `Dog` class.
