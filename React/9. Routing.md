# 9.1 Introduction to React Router

## **What is routing?**

Routing refers to the process of determining how an application responds to a specific URL or path entered by a user. In the context of web applications, routing allows you to define different views or pages for different URLs, enabling navigation between different sections of your application. Each route typically corresponds to a specific component or view that should be rendered when the corresponding URL is accessed.

## **Why use React Router?**

React Router is a library specifically designed for handling routing in React applications. Here's why you should consider using React Router:

**Single-Page Applications (SPAs)**: React applications are often built as SPAs, where the entire application loads initially, and then navigation between different sections of the app happens without a full page reload. React Router facilitates this by managing the rendering of different components based on URLs.

**Declarative Routing**: React Router provides a declarative way of defining your application's routes using components. This makes it easier to understand and manage the different routes and their associated components.

**Dynamic Routing**: React Router supports dynamic routing, which means you can define routes with parameters that change based on user input. This is crucial for applications that require personalized or dynamic content.

**Nested Routing**: Many applications have complex UI structures with nested components and views. React Router supports nested routing, allowing you to represent these hierarchies in your URL structure and components.

**History Management**: React Router manages the browser's history, enabling you to programmatically navigate, go back, or go forward without affecting the page's state.

**Location-Based Rendering**: With React Router, different components can be rendered based on the current URL, enabling a smooth user experience with proper content rendering and state management.

**URL Management**: React Router abstracts away the complexities of handling URLs and query parameters, making it easier to work with URL-based navigation.

**SEO and Deep Linking**: Proper routing is essential for search engine optimization (SEO) and deep linking, ensuring that each section of your application is accessible through its own URL, making it more search engine-friendly and shareable.

**Community and Documentation**: React Router is widely used in the React community, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and community support available. Its well-maintained documentation provides clear guidance on how to implement various routing scenarios.

# 9.2 Basic Routing

## **Setting up routes using `BrowserRouter` and `Route` components**

Setting up routes using the `BrowserRouter` and `Route` components is the fundamental step in implementing routing in a React application using React Router. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install React Router:**
   Before you start, make sure you have React Router installed in your project. You can install it using npm or yarn:
   
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
   # or
   yarn add react-router-dom
   ```

2. **Create Route Components:**
   Decide on the components you want to render for different routes in your application.

3. **Wrap your App with `BrowserRouter`:**
   Open your main application file (often `index.js` or `App.js`) and import `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`. Wrap your application's component hierarchy with the `BrowserRouter` component.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
   import App from './App'; // Your main application component
   
   ReactDOM.render(
     <BrowserRouter>
       <App />
     </BrowserRouter>,
     document.getElementById('root')
   );
   ```

4. **Define Routes using `Route` Components:**
   Inside your main application component (e.g., `App.js`), import the necessary components from `react-router-dom` and use the `Route` component to define your routes.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
   import Home from './Home'; // Your Home component
   import About from './About'; // Your About component
   
   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <Switch>
           <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
           <Route path="/about" component={About} />
         </Switch>
       </div>
     );
   }
   
   export default App;
   ```

   In this example, the `Switch` component is used to ensure that only the first matching route is rendered. The `exact` attribute on the `/` route ensures that it matches only when the URL is exactly `/`.

5. **Create Your Components:**
   Create the `Home` and `About` components (or any other components you defined as routes) and add the content you want to display for each route.

6. **Navigation:**
   Now you can use the `Link` component to navigate between different routes. Import `Link` from `react-router-dom` and use it in your components.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
   
   function Home() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Home</h1>
         <p>Welcome to the home page!</p>
         <Link to="/about">Go to About</Link>
       </div>
     );
   }
   
   export default Home;
   ```

7. **Testing:**
   Run your application and navigate to the specified routes using the links you've set up. You should see the corresponding components rendered when you access different URLs.

## **Creating basic navigation with `Link` and `NavLink`**

Creating basic navigation with the `Link` and `NavLink` components in React Router allows you to create clickable links that navigate to different routes within your application. Both components provide ways to navigate without causing a full page reload. Here's how you can use them:

1. **Using `Link`:**
   The `Link` component creates a navigation link that, when clicked, changes the URL and renders the associated route component without a full page reload.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
   
   function Navigation() {
     return (
       <nav>
         <ul>
           <li>
             <Link to="/">Home</Link>
           </li>
           <li>
             <Link to="/about">About</Link>
           </li>
         </ul>
       </nav>
     );
   }
   
   export default Navigation;
   ```

2. **Using `NavLink`:**
   The `NavLink` component is similar to `Link`, but it provides additional styling and behavior enhancements, particularly for indicating the currently active route.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';
   
   function Navigation() {
     return (
       <nav>
         <ul>
           <li>
             <NavLink exact to="/" activeClassName="active">Home</NavLink>
           </li>
           <li>
             <NavLink to="/about" activeClassName="active">About</NavLink>
           </li>
         </ul>
       </nav>
     );
   }
   
   export default Navigation;
   ```

   In the example above, the `activeClassName` prop is used to add a CSS class to the active link. This allows you to style the active link differently, making it clear which route is currently active.

Remember that the `to` prop in both `Link` and `NavLink` should be set to the URL path you want to navigate to. Additionally, you need to make sure your application is wrapped in a `BrowserRouter` component for routing to work properly.

## **Accessing route parameters using the `useParams` hook**

**Route Parameters and Dynamic Segments in URLs:**
Route parameters allow you to define parts of your URL as dynamic segments, allowing you to match URLs with varying values in those segments. For example, in the route path `/user/:username`, `:username` is a route parameter that can hold different values based on the URL.

**Accessing Route Parameters using the `useParams` hook:**
The `useParams` hook from the `react-router-dom` library allows you to access the route parameters from within a component. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, define a route with a parameter in your `Route` component:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
   import UserProfile from './UserProfile'; // Your component
   
   function App() {
     return (
       <Router>
         <div>
           {/* Link to the user profile */}
           <Link to="/user/johndoe">John Doe's Profile</Link>
           <Link to="/user/janesmith">Jane Smith's Profile</Link>
   
           {/* Route with a parameter */}
           <Route path="/user/:username" component={UserProfile} />
         </div>
       </Router>
     );
   }
   
   export default App;
   ```

2. In your `UserProfile` component, import the `useParams` hook and use it to access the parameter values:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
   
   function UserProfile() {
     const { username } = useParams();
     
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>User Profile</h1>
         <p>Username: {username}</p>
       </div>
     );
   }
   
   export default UserProfile;
   ```

When you navigate to URLs like `/user/johndoe` or `/user/janesmith`, the `UserProfile` component will receive the `username` parameter from the URL and display it accordingly.

# 9.3 Nested Routing

## **Creating nested routes and route hierarchies**

Creating nested routes and route hierarchies in React Router allows you to structure your application's UI and components in a hierarchical manner. This is particularly useful for building complex applications with multiple levels of navigation. Here's how you can create nested routes:

**1. Define Parent and Child Components:**
Create the components that will serve as the parent and child components for your nested routes.

```jsx
// ParentComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import { Link, Route, Switch, useRouteMatch } from 'react-router-dom';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

function ParentComponent() {
  const { path, url } = useRouteMatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to={`${url}/child`}>Child Component</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>

      <Switch>
        <Route path={`${path}/child`} component={ChildComponent} />
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

```jsx
// ChildComponent.js
import React from 'react';

function ChildComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Child Component</h2>
      {/* Content of the child component */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ChildComponent;
```

**2. Set up the Parent Route:**
Define the parent route using the `Route` component and render the `ParentComponent` when the route is matched.

```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import ParentComponent from './ParentComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/parent">Parent Component</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        <Route path="/parent" component={ParentComponent} />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**3. Nested Route Navigation:**
In the `ParentComponent`, you can use the `useRouteMatch` hook to get the current `path` and `url` of the parent route. Use these values to create links to the nested child components.

**4. Nested Route Rendering:**
Inside the `ParentComponent`, use the `Switch` component to define the nested routes. These routes will be matched within the context of the parent route. The `Route` components within the `Switch` will render the appropriate child components when their paths are matched.

## **Using the `useRouteMatch` hook for nested route matching**

The `useRouteMatch` hook from React Router provides information about the currently matched route. When you destructure its return value, you can access various properties that are useful for creating dynamic and nested routes. Here are the properties that you can destructure from the `useRouteMatch` hook:

```jsx
const {
  path,       // The path pattern used to match the route
  url,        // The matched portion of the URL (useful for generating links)
  isExact,    // A boolean indicating if the route is an exact match
  params,     // An object containing parameters extracted from the URL
} = useRouteMatch();
```

1. **`path`:**
   The `path` property represents the route's path pattern. It's the original pattern you defined for the route in your `Route` component. It can be useful for creating nested routes since it's the parent route's path that you can append child routes to.

2. **`url`:**
   The `url` property is the portion of the URL that matched the `path` pattern. It's particularly useful for generating relative links within the matched route's context.

3. **`isExact`:**
   The `isExact` property is a boolean that indicates whether the current URL exactly matches the `path` pattern. This is useful for distinguishing between exact and non-exact matches.

4. **`params`:**
   The `params` property is an object containing key-value pairs for route parameters extracted from the URL. These parameters are defined using colon (`:`) syntax in the `path` pattern.

Here's an example of how you might use these properties:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useRouteMatch } from 'react-router-dom';

function UserProfile() {
  const { path, url, params } = useRouteMatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Profile</h1>
      <p>Path: {path}</p>
      <p>URL: {url}</p>
      <p>User ID: {params.userId}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UserProfile;
```

In this example, if the URL matches `/user/123`, the `params.userId` would contain the value `123`.

# 9.4 Programmatic Navigation

## **Navigating between routes using `history` object and `push`, `replace` methods**

In React Router, you can navigate between routes programmatically using the `history` object and its `push` and `replace` methods. The `push` method adds a new entry to the history stack, while the `replace` method replaces the current entry in the stack. Here's how you can use these methods:

**1. Using the `history` Object:**
The `history` object is available in the `props` of a component rendered by a `Route`. You can access it using the `useHistory` hook from the `react-router-dom` library.

**2. Navigating with `push` Method:**
The `push` method adds a new entry to the history stack, which allows users to navigate back to the previous route using the browser's back button.

**3. Navigating with `replace` Method:**
The `replace` method replaces the current entry in the history stack. It's useful when you want to navigate without adding a new entry to the stack. This is commonly used for scenarios like login redirects, where you don't want users to be able to navigate back to the previous authenticated page.

Here's an example of how to use these concepts:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

function NavigationExample() {
  const history = useHistory();

  const handleNavigate = () => {
    // Navigating to a new route and adding a new entry to the history stack
    history.push('/new-route');
  };

  const handleReplace = () => {
    // Replacing the current entry in the history stack with a new route
    history.replace('/replaced-route');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Navigation Example</h1>
      <button onClick={handleNavigate}>Navigate</button>
      <button onClick={handleReplace}>Replace</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default NavigationExample;
```

In this example, clicking the "Navigate" button will add a new entry to the history stack, and clicking the "Replace" button will replace the current entry. These actions simulate navigation between routes using the `history` object.

# 9.5 Route Guards and Authentication

## **Implementing route guards to control access to certain routes**

Route guards, also known as navigation guards, are mechanisms that allow you to control access to certain routes in your application. You can use them to prevent users from accessing specific routes based on conditions like authentication status, user roles, permissions, and more. React Router doesn't have built-in route guards, but you can implement them using different techniques.

Here's an example of how you might implement route guards using React Router and conditional rendering:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link, Redirect, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

const isAuthenticated = true; // Replace with your authentication logic

// Route Guard Component
function PrivateRoute({ component: Component, ...rest }) {
  return (
    <Route
      {...rest}
      render={(props) =>
        isAuthenticated ? <Component {...props} /> : <Redirect to="/login" />
      }
    />
  );
}

function Dashboard() {
  return <h2>Dashboard</h2>;
}

function Profile() {
  return <h2>Profile</h2>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/profile">Profile</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        <Switch>
          <Route path="/login">
            {/* Your login component */}
          </Route>
          <PrivateRoute path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
          <PrivateRoute path="/profile" component={Profile} />
          <Redirect from="/" to="/dashboard" />
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `PrivateRoute` component is a custom wrapper around the `Route` component. It checks whether the user is authenticated and either renders the specified `Component` or redirects to the login page. The `PrivateRoute` component is used for routes that require authentication, such as the dashboard and profile routes.

# 9.6 Query Parameters and Search


## **Adding Query Parameters:**

   To add query parameters to a URL, you can use the `search` property of the `location` object, which is available from the `useLocation` hook in React Router.

   ```jsx
   import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

   const location = useLocation();
   const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(location.search);

   // Adding query parameters
   searchParams.set('paramName', 'paramValue');

   // Updating the URL with the new query parameters
   history.push(`?${searchParams.toString()}`);
   ```

## **Accessing Query Parameters:**

   To access query parameters from the URL, you can use the `useLocation` hook to get the `search` property of the `location` object.

   ```jsx
   import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

   const location = useLocation();
   const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(location.search);

   // Accessing query parameter value
   const paramValue = searchParams.get('paramName');
   ```

## **Updating Query Parameters:**

   To update query parameter values without changing the entire URL, you can modify the `search` property of the `location` object and then use the `history.push` method to update the URL.

   ```jsx
   import { useLocation, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

   const location = useLocation();
   const history = useHistory();
   const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(location.search);

   // Updating query parameter value
   searchParams.set('paramName', 'newParamValue');

   // Updating the URL with the updated query parameter
   history.push(`?${searchParams.toString()}`);
   ```

## **Removing Query Parameters:**

   To remove a query parameter from the URL, you can use the `delete` method of the `URLSearchParams` object.

   ```jsx
   import { useLocation, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

   const location = useLocation();
   const history = useHistory();
   const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(location.search);

   // Removing query parameter
   searchParams.delete('paramName');

   // Updating the URL without the removed query parameter
   history.push(`?${searchParams.toString()}`);
   ```

## **Using Query Parameters in Links:**

   To create links with query parameters, you can pass the query parameters as an object using the `search` property of the `Link` component.

   ```jsx
   import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

   // Creating a link with query parameters
   <Link to={{
     pathname: '/route',
     search: '?paramName=paramValue'
   }}>Link with Query Parameters</Link>
   ```

# 9.7 Route Transitions and Animation

Implementing route transitions and animations in a React application involves using CSS transitions, animations, or third-party libraries to create smooth visual effects when navigating between routes. Below is a concise cheat sheet with explanations on how to achieve route transitions and animations:

**1. CSS Transitions:**

CSS transitions allow you to smoothly change property values over a specified duration. To apply transitions to route transitions, follow these steps:

- Define CSS rules for entering and exiting the components:

```css
/* Transition when entering */
.route-enter {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateX(100%);
}
.route-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateX(0);
  transition: opacity 300ms, transform 300ms;
}

/* Transition when exiting */
.route-exit {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateX(0);
}
.route-exit-active {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateX(-100%);
  transition: opacity 300ms, transform 300ms;
}
```

- Apply the CSS classes based on the transition state:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';

function App() {
  return (
    <Route
      render={({ location }) => (
        <CSSTransition
          in={true}
          appear={true}
          timeout={300}
          classNames="route"
        >
          <Switch location={location}>
            {/* Your routes */}
          </Switch>
        </CSSTransition>
      )}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```

**2. React Transition Group:**

React Transition Group is a popular library that provides an easy way to perform transitions in React applications. It extends CSS transitions with lifecycle hooks.

- Install the library:

```bash
npm install react-transition-group
```

- Use the `TransitionGroup` and `CSSTransition` components:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { TransitionGroup, CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';

function App() {
  return (
    <Route
      render={({ location }) => (
        <TransitionGroup>
          <CSSTransition
            key={location.key}
            timeout={300}
            classNames="route"
          >
            <Switch location={location}>
              {/* Your routes */}
            </Switch>
          </CSSTransition>
        </TransitionGroup>
      )}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```

**3. Framer Motion:**

Framer Motion is a powerful animation library for React. It provides more advanced animations and control over the animation states.

- Install the library:

```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

- Use `motion.div` for components:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

function App() {
  return (
    <Route
      render={({ location }) => (
        <motion.div
          key={location.key}
          initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 100 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
          exit={{ opacity: 0, x: -100 }}
          transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
        >
          <Switch location={location}>
            {/* Your routes */}
          </Switch>
        </motion.div>
      )}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```

# 9.8 Route Configuration and Lazy Loading

**Route Configuration Cheat Sheet:**

1. **Install React Router:**
   ```
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

2. **Import Required Components:**
   ```jsx
   import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
   ```

3. **Set Up Route Configuration:**
   ```jsx
   <Router>
     <Switch>
       <Route exact path="/" component={HomeComponent} />
       <Route path="/about" component={AboutComponent} />
       <Route path="/contact" component={ContactComponent} />
       <Route component={NotFoundComponent} />
     </Switch>
   </Router>
   ```

4. **Using `exact` for Exact Matching:**
   The `exact` prop ensures that only the exact URL path matches the route.

5. **Using `Switch` for Exclusive Matching:**
   The `Switch` component ensures that only the first matching route is rendered.

6. **Using `component` to Render Components:**
   The `component` prop specifies the component to render when the route is matched.

**Lazy Loading Cheat Sheet with Explanation:**

1. **Import `lazy` and `Suspense` from React:**
   ```jsx
   import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Create Lazy Components:**
   ```jsx
   const HomeComponent = lazy(() => import('./HomeComponent'));
   const AboutComponent = lazy(() => import('./AboutComponent'));
   const ContactComponent = lazy(() => import('./ContactComponent'));
   const NotFoundComponent = lazy(() => import('./NotFoundComponent'));
   ```

3. **Wrap Routes with `Suspense` for Lazy Loading:**
   ```jsx
   <Router>
     <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
       <Switch>
         <Route exact path="/" component={HomeComponent} />
         <Route path="/about" component={AboutComponent} />
         <Route path="/contact" component={ContactComponent} />
         <Route component={NotFoundComponent} />
       </Switch>
     </Suspense>
   </Router>
   ```

4. **Explanation:**
   - The `lazy` function wraps the dynamic import of the component. It returns a promise for the imported module.
   - The `Suspense` component allows you to specify a fallback UI while waiting for the lazy-loaded component to load.
   - When using lazy loading, components are loaded only when they're needed, improving the initial load time of your application.

# 9.9 HashRouter and BrowserRouter


### `HashRouter`

```jsx
import { HashRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/about">About</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `HashRouter` uses the hash portion of the URL to simulate different routes.
- Suitable for single-page applications (SPAs) that might be deployed on static servers (like GitHub Pages) where server configuration is limited.
- The hash part of the URL doesn't trigger a server request, making it suitable for client-side routing.
- URLs look like: `http://example.com/#/about`.

### `BrowserRouter`

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/about">About</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>

        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `BrowserRouter` uses the HTML5 history API to manage the history and create clean-looking URLs.
- Suitable for modern browsers that support the history API and when server-side configuration is available.
- Requires server configuration to handle real URLs, which means proper handling of URLs on the server side.
- URLs look like: `http://example.com/about`.

**Key Differences:**
- **HashRouter** uses hash (`#`) in the URL and doesn't require server-side configuration, making it easy to deploy SPAs on static servers.
- **BrowserRouter** uses clean URLs without a hash, providing a more conventional appearance but requiring proper server-side handling and configuration.

# 9.10 Using withRouter

Certainly! The `withRouter` Higher-Order Component (HOC) is used in React Router to access the routing-related props (such as `history`, `location`, and `match`) in components that are not directly rendered by a `Route` component. It's useful when you want to access the routing props in components that are not part of the route hierarchy, such as deeply nested components or components that are not directly rendered by a route.

Here's a quick cheat sheet explaining how to use `withRouter` with examples:

**1. Import `withRouter` from `react-router-dom`:**

```jsx
import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
```

**2. Wrap the Component:**
Wrap the component you want to enhance with the `withRouter` HOC. This will inject the routing-related props into the component.

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ history, location, match }) => {
  // Access routing props (history, location, match) here
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your component content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default withRouter(MyComponent);
```

**3. Accessing Routing Props:**
After wrapping the component with `withRouter`, you can directly access the routing props in your component.

- `history`: Provides access to the browser's history object, allowing you to navigate, go back, or go forward programmatically.

- `location`: Represents the current location, including the current URL and query parameters.

- `match`: Contains information about how the current URL matches the route's path.

Here's an example demonstrating how to use `withRouter`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

const MyComponent = ({ history, location, match }) => {
  const handleNavigate = () => {
    history.push('/new-route'); // Programmatically navigate
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Component Details</h1>
      <p>Location: {location.pathname}</p>
      <p>Matched URL: {match.url}</p>
      <button onClick={handleNavigate}>Navigate</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default withRouter(MyComponent);
```

In this example, the `MyComponent` has access to the routing props even though it's not directly rendered by a `Route` component. This allows you to use routing features in components that are not part of the main route hierarchy.
