Certainly, I've organized the syllabus in the recommended learning order, including the new topics for Redux Toolkit 2.0:

**Module 1: Introduction to Redux and Redux Toolkit**

1.1. Understanding the need for state management in web applications.
1.2. Introduction to Redux and its core principles.
1.3. Challenges with using Redux without Redux Toolkit.
1.4. What Redux Toolkit is and its goals.

**Module 2: Setting Up Redux Toolkit**

2.1. Installation and setup of Redux Toolkit in a JavaScript application.
2.2. Update `configureStore` to use the new `autoBatchEnhancer` enhancer by default.
2.3. Defining the initial state and reducers.
2.4. Integrating Redux Toolkit with React.

**Module 3: Slices and Reducers**

3.1. Understanding the concept of "slices" in Redux Toolkit.
3.2. Creating a slice with `createSlice`.
3.3. Defining actions, reducers, and initial state within a slice.
3.4. Combining slices into a root reducer.

**Module 4: Actions and Action Creators**

4.1. Exploring the different types of actions in Redux Toolkit.
4.5. Using the new `createAction` with callback syntax to declare thunks directly inside the reducers field.
4.3. Dispatching actions in React components.
4.4. Handling asynchronous actions with Redux Toolkit.

**Module 5: Selectors and the Redux Store**

5.1. Using selectors to retrieve data from the Redux store.
5.2. Creating custom selectors with `createSelector`.
5.3. Accessing and updating state in React components.
5.4. Memoization and performance optimizations.

**Module 6: Middleware and Thunks**

6.1. Introduction to middleware in Redux.
6.2. Adding middleware to the Redux store.
6.3. Writing custom middleware for logging, async actions, etc.
6.5. Using the new `dynamicMiddleware` middleware to dynamically add and remove middleware at runtime.
6.4. Using thunks to handle asynchronous operations.

**Module 7: DevTools and Debugging**

7.1. Integration of Redux DevTools for debugging.
7.2. Time-travel debugging and inspecting actions and state changes.
7.3. Monitoring the Redux store in the browser.

**Module 8: Best Practices and Patterns**

8.1. Common patterns for structuring Redux Toolkit applications.
8.2. Handling complex state management scenarios.
8.3. Code organization and file structure.
8.5. Using the new `autoBatchEnhancer` enhancer to automatically batch actions together for improved performance.
8.4. Error handling and validation in Redux Toolkit.

**Module 9: Testing and Quality Assurance**

9.1. Update unit testing examples to use the new `createSelector` syntax.
9.2. Mocking the Redux store for testing React components.
9.3. Integration testing with Redux Toolkit.
9.4. Code coverage and test-driven development (TDD).

**Module 10: Advanced Topics**

10.1. Server-side rendering (SSR) with Redux Toolkit.
10.2. Local storage and persistence of state.
10.3. Handling global app configurations.
10.4. Internationalization (i18n) with Redux Toolkit.

This order reflects the sequence of learning for Redux Toolkit, starting with the fundamentals and gradually moving into more advanced topics, including the new features and enhancements in Redux Toolkit 2.0.
