- An object is a data structure that allows you to store and organize related data and functionality together.
- It represents a real-world entity or a collection of data and behaviors. Objects consist of properties and methods.

## 5.1 Object Literal Notation
- Object literal notation is a way to *define* objects using curly braces `{}`. 
- It allows you to create objects directly in your code without the need for a constructor function or class. Inside the curly braces, you define the properties and methods of the object using key-value pairs.
```js
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
  }
};

```

## 5.2 Access Object Properties 
- To access object properties, you can use the **dot notation** or **square bracket notation**. 
- With the **dot notation**, you specify the object followed by a dot `.` and then the property name. 
- With the **square bracket notation**, you use the object followed by square brackets `[]`, and inside the brackets, you put the property name as a string.
```js
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
console.log(person['age']); // Output: 30
```

## 5.3 Create constructor function

A constructor function in JavaScript is a special type of function that is used to create and initialize objects. It serves as a blueprint or a template for creating multiple instances of objects with similar properties and methods.
```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Creating objects using the constructor function
var person1 = new Person('John', 25);
var person2 = new Person('Jane', 30);

console.log(person1.name); // Output: John
console.log(person2.age); // Output: 30

```

**purpose of prototype property in constructor function**
In JavaScript, the `prototype` property of a constructor function is used to add properties and methods that are shared among all instances created by that constructor function. It allows you to define shared behavior for objects created from the constructor function.

Here are a few key points about the `prototype` property:

1. **Shared Properties and Methods:** Properties and methods added to the `prototype` property are shared among all instances created from the constructor function. Instead of creating copies of these properties and methods for each instance, they are referenced from the prototype, resulting in memory efficiency.

2. **Inheritance:** The `prototype` property is also used to establish inheritance in JavaScript. You can assign an instance of another object as the `prototype` of a constructor function, which allows instances created from the constructor to inherit properties and methods from that object.

3. **Property Lookup:** When you access a property or method on an instance created from a constructor function, JavaScript first checks if the property exists directly on the instance. If it doesn't find the property on the instance itself, it looks up the prototype chain to find it on the constructor function's `prototype` object.

Here's an example to illustrate the use of the `prototype` property:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
};

var person1 = new Person('John');
var person2 = new Person('Jane');

person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John
person2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Jane
```

In the example above, the `greet` method is added to the `prototype` of the `Person` constructor function. As a result, all instances created from `Person` can access and share this method through the prototype chain. This approach saves memory since each instance does not have its own copy of the `greet` method.

The `prototype` property is a fundamental concept in JavaScript's object-oriented programming and plays a crucial role in achieving inheritance, sharing functionality, and improving performance by reducing memory consumption.

## 5.4 `new` keyword

In JavaScript, the `new` keyword is used to create an instance of an object from a constructor function. It is an operator that initializes a newly created object and binds it to the constructor's prototype.

Here's how the `new` keyword is used:

1. **Define a constructor function:**
   First, you need to define a constructor function using the `function` keyword. The constructor function serves as a blueprint for creating objects of a specific type.

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
```

In this example, we define a constructor function `Person` that takes `name` and `age` as parameters and assigns them as properties of the object using `this.name` and `this.age`.

2. **Create an instance using `new`:**
   To create an instance of the object, you use the `new` keyword followed by the constructor function name and any required arguments.

```javascript
const person = new Person('John', 30);
```

In this case, we create a new instance of the `Person` object by invoking `Person` with the `new` keyword and passing `'John'` and `30` as arguments.

3. **Access the object properties and methods:**
   Once the instance is created, you can access its properties and methods using the dot notation.

```javascript
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
console.log(person.age); // Output: 30
```

In the example above, we access the `name` and `age` properties of the `person` object using `person.name` and `person.age`.

The `new` keyword performs the following steps:
- Creates a new empty object.
- Binds the newly created object to the prototype of the constructor function.
- Executes the constructor function with `this` set to the newly created object.
- Returns the newly created object.

## 5.5 Object Properties

To access and modify object properties in JavaScript, you can use the dot notation or square bracket notation. Let's explore how to access and modify object properties in a natural conversation:

1. **Accessing Object Properties:**
   You can access object properties using dot notation (`objectName.propertyName`) or square bracket notation (`objectName['propertyName']`).

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer'
};

console.log(person.name); // Output: John
console.log(person['age']); // Output: 30
```

In the example above, we access the `name` property of the `person` object using both dot notation (`person.name`) and square bracket notation (`person['age']`).

2. **Modifying Object Properties:**
   Object properties can be modified by assigning a new value to them using the assignment operator (`=`).

```javascript
person.name = 'Jane';
person['age'] = 35;

console.log(person.name); // Output: Jane
console.log(person.age); // Output: 35
```

In the example above, we modify the `name` property of the `person` object to `'Jane'` using dot notation (`person.name = 'Jane'`). We also modify the `age` property to `35` using square bracket notation (`person['age'] = 35`).

3. **Adding New Properties:**
   You can add new properties to an object by assigning a value to a property that doesn't exist.

```javascript
person.gender = 'Male';
person['city'] = 'New York';

console.log(person.gender); // Output: Male
console.log(person.city); // Output: New York
```

In this case, we add two new properties, `gender` and `city`, to the `person` object. We assign values to these properties, and they become part of the object.

4. **Deleting Object Properties:**
   You can remove a property from an object using the `delete` keyword followed by the object name and the property name.

```javascript
delete person.occupation;
delete person['city'];

console.log(person.occupation); // Output: undefined
console.log(person.city); // Output: undefined
```

In the example above, we delete the `occupation` and `city` properties from the `person` object. After deletion, accessing those properties returns `undefined`.

## 5.6 Object Methods and Invocation

1. **Invoking Object Methods:** Object methods are invoked by using the dot notation to access the method and then adding parentheses `()` to execute it.
```js
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```

2. **Calling Object Methods with Arguments:** Object methods can also accept arguments, just like regular functions. When invoking an object method with arguments, you pass the values within the parentheses.
```js
const calculator = {
  add: function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
};

const result = calculator.add(5, 3);
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```
In this example, the `calculator` object has an `add` method that accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`. We invoke the `add` method with arguments `5` and `3`, which returns the sum of the two values.

## 5.7 `this` keyword

In the context of a method in JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the object on which the method is being invoked. It allows the method to access and manipulate the object's properties and other methods within its own scope.

Here's how `this` behaves and what it refers to in the method context:

1. Object Method:
   When a function is defined as a method inside an object, `this` refers to the object itself. It allows the method to access the object's properties and call other methods of the same object.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
  }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```

In this example, the `greet` method is defined within the `person` object. When we invoke `person.greet()`, `this` within the `greet` method refers to the `person` object, allowing us to access the `name` property using `this.name`.

2. Object Method within Nested Objects:
   If a method is invoked from a nested object within another method, `this` still refers to the object on which the outer method was invoked.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    getFullAddress: function() {
      return this.street + ', ' + this.name;
    }
  }
};

console.log(person.address.getFullAddress()); // Output: 123 Main St, John
```

In this example, the `getFullAddress` method is invoked as part of the `address` object within the `person` object. When we call `person.address.getFullAddress()`, `this` within the `getFullAddress` method still refers to the `address` object, allowing us to access the `street` property and the `name` property of the outer `person` object using `this.street` and `this.name`.

3. Event Handlers and Callbacks:
   In event handlers or callbacks assigned to object methods, `this` can lose its context and refer to something else. The value of `this` depends on how the event or callback function is invoked.

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector('button');

const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
  }
};

button.addEventListener('click', person.greet); // Output: Hello, my name is undefined
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, the `greet` method of the `person` object is invoked as an event handler. However, `this` within the event handler loses its context and refers to the button element instead of the `person` object. As a result, `this.name` is undefined.

To ensure that `this` retains its expected context in event handlers or callbacks, you can use techniques like binding `this` explicitly or using arrow functions, which maintain the lexical scope of `this`.

## 5.8 Prototypes and Inheritance

Prototypal inheritance is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. It provides a way to create a hierarchy of objects, where objects can inherit and extend the behavior of other objects.

Let's explore prototypal inheritance, the prototype chain, and creating/inheriting from prototypes in a natural conversation:

1. Prototype Chain:
   In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]`, which is either `null` or references another object. When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first checks if the object itself has that property. If not, it looks up the prototype chain, which is a series of linked objects, until it finds the property or reaches the end of the chain.

   For example, consider an object `child` that has a property called `property1`. If `property1` is not found in `child`, JavaScript looks for it in the `[[Prototype]]` object (also called the parent or prototype object) linked to `child`. This process continues until the property is found or until the end of the prototype chain.

2. The `prototype` Property:
   Every constructor function in JavaScript has a `prototype` property. It is an object that serves as the blueprint for creating objects through that constructor function. The `prototype` object is automatically assigned as the `[[Prototype]]` of the objects created with the constructor function.

   For example, consider a constructor function `Person`. The `prototype` property of `Person` holds methods and properties that will be inherited by instances created with `new Person()`.

3. Creating and Inheriting from Prototypes:
   To create a prototype, you define a constructor function and assign properties and methods to its `prototype` object. Then, you can create new objects that inherit from the prototype using the `new` keyword.

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
};

const person = new Person('John');
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```

In this example, we define a `Person` constructor function. We assign the `name` property within the constructor, and we add a `greet` method to the `Person.prototype` object. When we create a new instance using `new Person('John')`, the `[[Prototype]]` of the `person` object is set to `Person.prototype`, allowing the `person` object to inherit the `greet` method.

## 5.9 Object property enumeration methods

In JavaScript, there are several methods available for enumerating or iterating over the properties of an object. These methods allow you to loop through the object's properties and perform actions or retrieve information about each property. Here are some commonly used object property enumeration methods:

1. `for...in` loop:
   The `for...in` loop iterates over all enumerable properties of an object, including properties inherited from its prototype chain. It assigns each property name to a variable, and you can access the corresponding value using the object's name.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer'
};

for (let prop in person) {
  console.log(prop + ': ' + person[prop]);
}
```

In this example, the `for...in` loop iterates over the `person` object, and for each property, it logs the property name and its value.

2. `Object.keys()`:
   The `Object.keys()` method returns an array containing the enumerable property names of an object. It only includes properties that belong to the object itself, not those inherited from its prototype chain.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer'
};

const keys = Object.keys(person);
console.log(keys); // Output: ['name', 'age', 'occupation']
```

In this example, `Object.keys(person)` returns an array containing the property names of the `person` object.

3. `Object.values()`:
   The `Object.values()` method returns an array containing the values of enumerable properties of an object. It retrieves only the property values, not the property names.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer'
};

const values = Object.values(person);
console.log(values); // Output: ['John', 30, 'Engineer']
```

In this example, `Object.values(person)` returns an array containing the values of the properties in the `person` object.

4. `Object.entries()`:
   The `Object.entries()` method returns an array of arrays, where each inner array contains a property name-value pair. It includes all enumerable properties of an object, both own properties and those inherited from its prototype chain.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer'
};

const entries = Object.entries(person);
console.log(entries);
// Output: [['name', 'John'], ['age', 30], ['occupation', 'Engineer']]
```

In this example, `Object.entries(person)` returns an array of arrays, with each inner array representing a property name-value pair of the `person` object.

These object property enumeration methods provide various ways to iterate over and access the properties of an object. They allow you to perform operations on the properties or retrieve information about them, making it easier to work with objects in JavaScript.

## 5.10 Converting objects to JSON

In JavaScript, you can convert objects to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) using the `JSON.stringify()` method. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is widely used for data serialization and communication between systems. Here's how you can convert objects to JSON:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer'
};

const json = JSON.stringify(person);

console.log(json);
// Output: {"name":"John","age":30,"occupation":"Engineer"}
```

In this example, the `JSON.stringify()` method is used to convert the `person` object to a JSON string. The resulting JSON string contains the object's properties and their corresponding values.

`JSON.stringify()` can also accept additional parameters to control the behavior of the conversion:

- `replacer` (optional): A function that allows you to customize the transformation of specific properties or filter out properties from the JSON string. It can be used to include/exclude properties or transform property values before conversion.
- `space` (optional): A string or number that specifies the indentation level for pretty-printing the resulting JSON string. It adds indentation and line breaks to improve readability.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer'
};

const json = JSON.stringify(person, ['name', 'age'], 2);

console.log(json);
/* Output:
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30
}
*/
```

In this example, the `replacer` parameter is an array that specifies which properties should be included in the JSON string. The `space` parameter is set to `2`, resulting in formatted and indented JSON.

Converting objects to JSON allows you to transmit or store data in a structured format that can be easily consumed by other systems or programming languages. It's important to note that JSON represents data and doesn't include methods or non-enumerable properties of an object. To convert JSON back to an object, you can use `JSON.parse()`.

## 5.11 Parsing JSON to create JavaScript objects

In JavaScript, you can parse JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) strings to create JavaScript objects using the `JSON.parse()` method. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is commonly used for data serialization and communication between systems. Here's how you can parse JSON to create JavaScript objects:

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name":"John","age":30,"occupation":"Engineer"}';

const person = JSON.parse(jsonString);

console.log(person);
// Output: { name: 'John', age: 30, occupation: 'Engineer' }
```

In this example, the `JSON.parse()` method is used to parse the `jsonString` and create a JavaScript object `person`. The resulting object contains properties and their corresponding values based on the JSON string.

`JSON.parse()` can handle more complex JSON structures and nested objects:

```javascript
const jsonString = '{"name":"John","age":30,"occupation":"Engineer","address":{"city":"New York","country":"USA"}}';

const person = JSON.parse(jsonString);

console.log(person);
/* Output:
{
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer',
  address: { city: 'New York', country: 'USA' }
}
*/
```

In this example, the parsed object `person` includes a nested object `address`.

It's important to note that `JSON.parse()` throws an error if the provided JSON string is not valid. Make sure the JSON string is correctly formatted and follows the JSON syntax rules.

Parsing JSON to create JavaScript objects allows you to work with structured data that can be easily consumed and manipulated in your JavaScript code. It's commonly used when receiving JSON data from APIs or when working with JSON-formatted data from other sources.

## 5.12 Extracting values from objects using destructuring

Extracting values from objects using destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to unpack values from objects into separate variables. It provides a concise way to extract specific properties from an object and assign them to variables.
```js
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer'
};

// Destructuring assignment
const { name, age, occupation } = person;

console.log(name); // Output: John
console.log(age); // Output: 30
console.log(occupation); // Output: Engineer
```

```js
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Engineer',
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    country: 'USA'
  }
};

// Destructuring nested object
const { name, age, occupation, address: { city, country } } = person;

console.log(city); // Output: New York
console.log(country); // Output: USA
```

## 5.13 Merging objects using spread syntax

```js
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 };

// Merging objects using spread syntax
const mergedObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };

console.log(mergedObj);
// Output: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
```
