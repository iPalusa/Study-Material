# 3. Functions

A function is a reusable block of code or programming statements designed to perform a certain task. A function is declared by a function key word followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). A parentheses can take a parameter. If a function take a parameter it will be called with argument. A function can also take a default parameter

**Function makes code:**
- clean and easy to read
- reusable
- easy to test

## 3.1 Function Declaration

```js
//declaring a function without a parameter
function functionName() {
  // code goes here
}
functionName() // calling function by its name and with parentheses
```

## 3.2 Anonymous Function

Anonymous function or without function name

```js
const anonymousFun = function() {
  console.log(
    'I am an anonymous function and my value is stored in anonymousFun'
  )
}
```

## 3.3 Expression Function

Expression functions are anonymous functions. After we create a function without a name and we assign it to a variable. To return a value from the function we should call the variable. Look at the example below.

```js
// Function expression
const square = function(n) {
  return n * n
}

console.log(square(2)) // -> 4
```

## 3.4 Self Invoking Functions

Self invoking functions are anonymous functions which do not need to be called to return a value.

```js
(function(n) {
  console.log(n * n)
})(2) // 4, but instead of just printing if we want to return and store the data, we do as shown below

let squaredNum = (function(n) {
  return n * n
})(10)

console.log(squaredNum)
```

## 3.5 Arrow Function

Arrow function is an alternative to write a function, however function declaration and arrow function have some minor differences.

Arrow function uses arrow instead of the keyword *function* to declare a function. Let us see both function declaration and arrow function.

```js
const square = n => {
  return n * n
}

console.log(square(2))  // -> 4
```

### 3.6. Difference between parameters and arguments

**Parameter:**
A parameter is a variable in the function definition that is used to hold a value that is passed into the function when it is called. It is essentially a placeholder for a value that will be provided later.

**Argument:**
An argument is the actual value that is passed into the function when it is called. It is the value that is assigned to the parameter.

```js
function addNumbers(num1, num2) { //num1 and num2 are parameters
  return num1 + num2;
}
addNumbers(5, 3) //5 and 3 are arguments
```

## 3.7  Difference b/w `return` statement and `console.log`

`return` is used to return a value from a function to the calling code. When a function is called and it encounters a `return` statement, the value following the `return` keyword is passed back to the calling code, and the function execution is terminated. The value returned by the function can then be stored in a variable or used in some other way by the calling code.

`console.log()` is a method used to print information to the console for debugging purposes. It doesn't actually return a value to the calling code; rather, it outputs the value to the console where it can be viewed by the developer. `console.log()` is useful for displaying values or debugging information that help the developer understand how their code is executing.

## 3.8 Pass function as argument

To pass a function as an argument, you need to define the function you want to pass as a parameter and then pass its name as an argument to the function that will receive it.

```js
function multiplyByTwo(num) {
  return num * 2;
}

function doSomethingWithNumber(num, operation) {
  return operation(num);
}

let result = doSomethingWithNumber(5, multiplyByTwo);
console.log(result); // Output: 10
```

In this example, we have a function `multiplyByTwo` that multiplies a number by 2. We also have a function `doSomethingWithNumber` that takes a number and an operation as arguments and returns the result of applying the operation to the number. The `operation` argument is expected to be a function.

We then call `doSomethingWithNumber` with the arguments `5` and `multiplyByTwo`, which means we want to apply the `multiplyByTwo` function to the number `5`. The result is `10`, which is returned and printed to the console.

## 3.9 Function expression

A function expression is a type of function declaration in JavaScript where a function is assigned to a variable as its value. It involves using the assignment operator "=" to assign an anonymous or named function to a variable.
```js
var multiply = function(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

```js
var greet = function sayHello(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("John"); // outputs "Hello, John!"

sayHello("John"); // ReferenceError: sayHello is not defined
```

## 3.10 self-invoking function / Immediately Invoked Function Expression

A self-invoking function, also known as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE), is a function that runs automatically as soon as it's defined. 

It's typically used to create a private scope for variables or to avoid naming collisions with other JavaScript code.

Self-invoking functions are used in cases where a piece of code needs to be executed immediately without being called explicitly. They can be used to initialize code or to create a private scope to avoid polluting the global namespace. They are also commonly used in modular design patterns to define and execute a module in a single line of code.


```js
(function() {
  // code to be executed
})();
```


## 3.11 Higher-order function

A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result.
```js
function mapArray(array, fn) {
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    result.push(fn(array[i]));
  }
  return result;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const double = x => x * 2;
const doubledNumbers = mapArray(numbers, double);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Higher-order functions:**
`map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `sort()`, `forEach()`, `every()`, `some()`, `find()`, `findIndex()`, `flat()`.

## 3.12 First-class function

A first-class function is a function that can be treated like any other value, including being assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. This means that functions in JavaScript are not just executable code, but also a type of data that can be manipulated and used in flexible ways.
```js
const greet = function(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

greet("John"); // logs "Hello, John!"

const sayHello = greet; // assign the function to another variable

sayHello("Mary"); // logs "Hello, Mary!"
```

In this example, we define a function called `greet` that takes a name argument and logs a greeting message to the console. We then assign this function to a variable called `sayHello`. Because functions are first-class in JavaScript, we can treat `sayHello` just like any other value, including passing it as an argument to another function, returning it from a function, or assigning it to another variable.

In the example above, we pass the `sayHello` function as an argument to `setTimeout`, which is a built-in function that executes a function after a specified amount of time has passed:

```js
setTimeout(sayHello, 1000); // wait for 1 second, then logs "Hello, Mary!"

```

This is just one example of how first-class functions can be used in JavaScript. By treating functions as values, we can write more flexible, modular, and reusable code, and use functions in creative ways to solve complex programming problems.

## 3.13 Generator function

A generator function in JavaScript is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed during execution, allowing for the creation of iterables that can be consumed one value at a time.

A generator function is defined using the `function*` syntax, and returns a generator object when called. The generator object can be used to control the execution of the generator function, and can be iterated over using a `for...of` loop or the `next()` method.
```js
function* infiniteNumbers() {
  let i = 0;
  while (true) {
    yield i++;
  }
}

const numbers = infiniteNumbers();

console.log(numbers.next().value); // logs 0
console.log(numbers.next().value); // logs 1
console.log(numbers.next().value); // logs 2
// and so on...
```

In this example, the `infiniteNumbers` function is defined using the `function*` syntax, and contains a `while` loop that generates an infinite sequence of numbers using the `yield` keyword. When the `yield` keyword is encountered, the function is paused and the current value is returned. When the function is called again using the `next()` method, execution resumes from where it left off, and the next value is generated.

When we call `infiniteNumbers()`, we get back a generator object that can be used to control the execution of the function. We can call the `next()` method on the generator object to generate the next value in the sequence, and access the generated value using the `value` property of the result.

Generator functions can be used to create iterables that are more memory-efficient and flexible than arrays, and can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to generate a large or infinite sequence of values, or when you need to generate values on demand instead of all at once.

#### `yield` keyword

The `yield` keyword in JavaScript is used in generator functions to pause and resume the execution of the function, and to produce a sequence of values that can be consumed one at a time.

When a `yield` statement is encountered inside a generator function, the function is paused at that point and the current value is returned to the calling code. The state of the function is saved, including the values of local variables, and can be resumed later using the `next()` method of the generator object.
```js
function* fibonacci() {
  let a = 0, b = 1;
  while (true) {
    yield a;
    [a, b] = [b, a + b];
  }
}

const fib = fibonacci();
console.log(fib.next().value); // logs 0
console.log(fib.next().value); // logs 1
console.log(fib.next().value); // logs 1
console.log(fib.next().value); // logs 2
console.log(fib.next().value); // logs 3
console.log(fib.next().value); // logs 5
// and so on...

```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function uses a `while` loop to generate an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers using the `yield` keyword. Each time the `yield` keyword is encountered, the function is paused and the current value of `a` is returned. The `a` and `b` variables are then updated to generate the next value in the sequence.

When we call `fibonacci()`, we get back a generator object that can be used to control the execution of the function. We can call the `next()` method on the generator object to generate the next value in the sequence, and access the generated value using the `value` property of the result.

The `yield` keyword is a powerful feature of generator functions that enables the creation of iterables that can be consumed one value at a time, and can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to generate a large or infinite sequence of values, or when you need to generate values on demand instead of all at once.

## 3.14 Recursive function

A recursive function in JavaScript is a function that calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a specific condition, called the base case. 

Recursion is a powerful programming technique that allows a problem to be broken down into smaller subproblems that can be solved using the same algorithm.

A recursive function consists of two parts: the base case and the recursive case. The base case is the condition that stops the recursion and returns a value. The recursive case is the part of the function that calls itself with a modified argument until the base case is reached.
```js
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // logs 120
```

In this example, the `factorial` function calls itself with a modified argument until the base case is reached. The base case is when `n` equals 0, in which case the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function multiplies `n` by the result of calling `factorial(n - 1)`.

Recursive functions can be useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems that can be solved using the same algorithm. They can be particularly useful for working with data structures that have a recursive nature, such as trees or linked lists. However, recursive functions can be memory-intensive and can cause a stack overflow error if the recursion depth becomes too large, so they should be used with care.

##  3.15 call stack

The call stack in JavaScript is a data structure that records the function calls in a program. It keeps track of the order in which functions are called and their context, allowing the program to return to the correct point of execution after a function call has completed.

When a function is called, a new frame is added to the call stack containing information about the function call, including the function name, its arguments, and its local variables. The current function is paused, and the new function starts executing. When the new function completes, its frame is removed from the call stack, and the previous function is resumed.
```js
function a() {
  console.log('a');
  b();
}

function b() {
  console.log('b');
  c();
}

function c() {
  console.log('c');
}

a();

```

In this example, calling `a()` adds a frame to the call stack with the function name `a`. Inside `a()`, calling `b()` adds another frame to the call stack with the function name `b`. Inside `b()`, calling `c()` adds a third frame to the call stack with the function name `c`. When `c()` completes, its frame is removed from the call stack, and the program resumes executing `b()`. When `b()` completes, its frame is removed from the call stack, and the program resumes executing `a()`. When `a()` completes, its frame is removed from the call stack, and the program finishes executing.

**how call stack work with recursive functions:**

The call stack works with recursive functions in the same way as with any other function. When a recursive function is called, a new frame is added to the call stack, and the function starts executing. If the function calls itself, another frame is added to the call stack, and the new instance of the function starts executing.

Each time the function calls itself, a new frame is added to the call stack, and the current instance of the function is paused until the new instance completes. When the new instance completes, its frame is removed from the call stack, and the previous instance of the function resumes execution.
```js
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

console.log(factorial(5));
```

In this example, calling `factorial(5)` adds a frame to the call stack with the function name `factorial` and the argument `5`. Inside `factorial(5)`, calling `factorial(4)` adds another frame to the call stack with the function name `factorial` and the argument `4`. This process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the frames are removed from the call stack in reverse order, and the final result is returned.

## 3.16 Function composition

Function composition is a technique in functional programming where two or more functions are combined to form a new function. The output of one function is used as the input of another function, allowing complex operations to be built up from simpler building blocks.

In JavaScript, function composition can be achieved using higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. For example, the `map` method can be used to transform an array of data using a series of functions:
```js
const addOne = x => x + 1;
const double = x => x * 2;

const data = [1, 2, 3];
const result = data.map(addOne).map(double); // [4, 6, 8]
```

In this example, the `addOne` and `double` functions are composed using the `map` method. The `addOne` function is first applied to each element of the array, producing a new array `[2, 3, 4]`. The `double` function is then applied to each element of the new array, producing the final result `[4, 6, 8]`.

Function composition can also be achieved using the `compose` function, which is a higher-order function that takes two or more functions and returns a new function that applies them in sequence:
```js
const compose = (...fns) => x => fns.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), x);

const addOne = x => x + 1;
const double = x => x * 2;

const addOneThenDouble = compose(double, addOne);

console.log(addOneThenDouble(1)); // 4
```

In this example, the `compose` function is used to create a new function `addOneThenDouble` that first applies the `addOne` function and then the `double` function. The `addOneThenDouble` function can be called with an argument `x`, and the output will be the result of applying the `addOne` and `double` functions to `x`.

## 3.17 function decorators 

Function decorators are a pattern in JavaScript where a function is wrapped with another function in order to modify its behavior. This pattern is often used to add functionality to existing functions without modifying their original implementation.

In JavaScript, function decorators can be implemented using higher-order functions.
```js
function withExecutionTime(fn) {
  return function(...args) {
    const start = Date.now();
    const result = fn(...args);
    const end = Date.now();
    console.log(`Execution time: ${end - start}ms`);
    return result;
  }
}

function myFunction() {
  // some code here
}

const myFunctionWithExecutionTime = withExecutionTime(myFunction);

myFunctionWithExecutionTime();
```

In this example, the `withExecutionTime` function is a decorator that takes a function `fn` as an argument and returns a new function that wraps `fn`. The new function logs the execution time of `fn` and then calls `fn` with the original arguments. The result of `fn` is then returned.

The `myFunction` function is the function that we want to decorate with the execution time logging functionality. We create a new function `myFunctionWithExecutionTime` by passing `myFunction` to the `withExecutionTime` decorator. When `myFunctionWithExecutionTime` is called, it logs the execution time of `myFunction` and then calls `myFunction`.

## 3.18 function currying

Function currying is a technique in functional programming where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. The output of each function is then used as the input of the next function, until all the required arguments have been supplied and the final result is produced. Function currying can be achieved using closures.

```js
function add(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const addTwo = add(2);
console.log(addTwo(3)); // 5
```

In this example, the `add` function takes a single argument `a` and returns a new function that takes another argument `b` and returns the sum of `a` and `b`. We can create a new function `addTwo` by calling `add` with an argument of `2`. The `addTwo` function then takes a single argument `b` and returns the sum of `2` and `b`.

Function currying can make code more modular and easier to reuse. By breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument, we can create new functions that are specialized for specific use cases. Currying can also make it easier to compose functions and create higher-order functions.

JavaScript has built-in support for function currying using the `bind` method. Here's an example using `bind` to curry the `add` function:
```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const addTwo = add.bind(null, 2);
console.log(addTwo(3)); // 5
```

In this example, we use `bind` to create a new function `addTwo` that is a curried version of `add` with the first argument set to `2`. The `null` value is used as the `this` value because `add` doesn't use `this`. We can then call `addTwo` with a single argument, which will be used as the second argument to `add`.

## 3.19 Call-by-value and Call-by-reference

In **call by value**, a copy of the value of the argument is passed to the function. This means that changes made to the argument inside the function do not affect the original value outside the function.
```js
function foo(x) {
  x = 5;
}

let y = 10;
foo(y);
console.log(y); // 10
```

In this example, the value of `y` is passed to the `foo` function. Inside the function, the value of `x` is set to 5. However, this change does not affect the value of `y` outside the function, because the function received a copy of the value of `y` and did not modify `y` itself.

In **call by reference**, a reference to the original value of the argument is passed to the function. This means that changes made to the argument inside the function affect the original value outside the function.
```js
function bar(obj) {
  obj.x = 5;
}

let obj = { x: 10 };
bar(obj);
console.log(obj.x); // 5
```

In this example, a reference to the `obj` object is passed to the `bar` function. Inside the function, the value of `obj.x` is set to 5. This change affects the original object outside the function, because the function received a reference to the object and modified its property `x`.

## 3.20 `arguments` object to handle variable numbers of arguments in a function

The `arguments` object is a built-in object in JavaScript that provides a way to access the arguments passed to a function. It is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function, regardless of the number of arguments or their data types.
```js
function sum() {
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    result += arguments[i];
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6
console.log(sum(4, 5, 6, 7)); // 22
console.log(sum(1.5, 2.5)); // 4
```

In this example, the `sum` function uses a loop to iterate over the `arguments` object and add up all the values passed to the function. The function can handle any number of arguments, and it will work with arguments of any data type.

Note that the `arguments` object is not an array, but an array-like object, so it does not have all the methods of a regular array. If you want to use array methods on the `arguments` object, you can convert it to an array using the `Array.from()` method or the spread operator `...`.
```js
function average() {
  let args = Array.from(arguments);
  let sum = args.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
  return sum / args.length;
}

console.log(average(1, 2, 3)); // 2
console.log(average(4, 5, 6, 7)); // 5.5
console.log(average(1.5, 2.5)); // 2
```

In this example, the `average` function uses the `Array.from()` method to convert the `arguments` object to an array, so that it can use the `reduce()` method to add up all the values passed to the function. The function then calculates the average and returns the result.


## 3.21 function hoisting

Function hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scope by the JavaScript interpreter before the code is executed. This means that you can call a function before it is declared in your code without getting an error.

```js
sayHello(); // "Hello!"

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}


sayHello(); // TypeError: sayHello is not a function

let sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

```


## 3.22 Difference between a synchronous and asynchronous function

the main difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions is how they handle blocking code.

A **synchronous function** is a function that executes in a blocking manner. This means that when a synchronous function is called, the code execution stops until the function returns a value. Synchronous functions are easy to reason about because they execute in a predictable order.
```js
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let result = addNumbers(2, 3);
console.log(result); // 5
```

An **asynchronous function** is a function that executes in a non-blocking manner. This means that when an asynchronous function is called, the code execution continues to the next line of code without waiting for the function to return a value. Instead, the function returns a promise, and the result is handled by a callback function or a `.then()` method.
```js
function addNumbersAsync(a, b) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(a + b);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

addNumbersAsync(2, 3)
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result); // 5
  });
```

In this example, the `addNumbersAsync` function executes asynchronously, using a `Promise` to handle the result. The `setTimeout` function is used to simulate a delay of 1 second. When the promise resolves, the `.then()` method is used to handle the result.

## 3.24 difference between an instance method and a static method

- **Instance method:** An instance method is a method that is associated with individual instances or objects created from a class or constructor function. It operates on the specific instance and can access instance-specific properties and methods. Instance methods are accessed through instances of the class or constructor function.
```js
class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  calculateArea() {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

const circle = new Circle(5);
console.log(circle.calculateArea()); // Output: 78.53981633974483
```
In the example above, the `calculateArea()` method is an *instance method*. It is defined within the class and is accessed through an *instance* of the `Circle` class (`circle`). The method operates on the specific instance of `circle` and can access the `radius` property of that instance.

- **static method:** A static method is a method that belongs to the class itself rather than its instances. It is associated with the class as a whole and not with any specific instance. Static methods are accessed directly through the class itself, rather than through instances of the class.
```js
class MathUtils {
  static multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.multiply(5, 3)); // Output: 15
```
In the example above, the `multiply()` method is a static method. It is defined within the `MathUtils` class and is accessed directly through the class itself (`MathUtils`). The method does not operate on any specific instance and can only access static properties or methods within the class.

## 3.25 call,apply, bind method

The `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` methods in JavaScript are used to control the execution context (the `this` value) of a function. They allow you to specify the value of `this` and, in some cases, pass arguments to the function. Let's discuss each method and how they work.

1. `call()`: The `call()` method invokes a function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments passed as separate parameters. It accepts the `this` value as its first argument, followed by the function arguments.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function(message) {
    console.log(message + ', my name is ' + this.name);
  }
};

const greetFunc = person.greet;
greetFunc.call(person, 'Hello'); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```

In the example above, `call()` is used to invoke the `greet` function with `person` as the `this` value and `'Hello'` as the argument.

2. `apply()`: The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but it accepts arguments as an array or an array-like object. The first argument is still the `this` value, and the second argument is an array or array-like object containing the function arguments.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function(message) {
    console.log(message + ', my name is ' + this.name);
  }
};

const greetFunc = person.greet;
greetFunc.apply(person, ['Hello']); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```

In the above example, `apply()` is used to invoke the `greet` function with `person` as the `this` value and `['Hello']` as the array of arguments.

3. `bind()`: The `bind()` method returns a new function with a bound `this` value and optionally pre-set arguments. It allows you to create a function that, when invoked, will have a fixed `this` value.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function(message) {
    console.log(message + ', my name is ' + this.name);
  }
};

const greetFunc = person.greet;
const boundGreetFunc = greetFunc.bind(person);
boundGreetFunc('Hello'); // Output: Hello, my name is John
```

In the example above, `bind()` is used to create a new function `boundGreetFunc` with `person` as the `this` value. When `boundGreetFunc('Hello')` is called, it retains the bound `this` value and passes `'Hello'` as an argument.

To summarize:
- `call()` invokes a function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments.
- `apply()` is similar to `call()`, but it accepts arguments as an array or array-like object.
- `bind()` returns a new function with a bound `this` value and optional pre-set arguments.

These methods are particularly useful when you want to control the execution context of a function and pass arguments explicitly.

## 3.26 Method Chain

In JavaScript, you can create a method chain by returning the current object (or a modified version of it) from a method, allowing subsequent method calls to be chained together. This technique is often used to achieve a fluent and readable coding style. Here's an example to demonstrate how to create a method chain:

```javascript
function Calculator() {
  this.value = 0;
}

Calculator.prototype.add = function(num) {
  this.value += num;
  return this; // Returning the current object
};

Calculator.prototype.subtract = function(num) {
  this.value -= num;
  return this; // Returning the current object
};

Calculator.prototype.multiply = function(num) {
  this.value *= num;
  return this; // Returning the current object
};

Calculator.prototype.getValue = function() {
  return this.value;
};

// Usage
const calc = new Calculator();

const result = calc.add(5).subtract(3).multiply(2).getValue();
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

In the above example, we have a `Calculator` constructor function with several methods (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `getValue`). Each method modifies the `value` property of the `Calculator` instance and returns `this`, which refers to the current object (the instance itself). By returning `this`, we allow method chaining to occur.

To create a method chain, you can simply call the methods one after another on the object instance. Each method modifies the state of the object and returns `this`, allowing the subsequent method to be invoked on the updated object. Finally, you can call a non-chaining method (`getValue` in this case) to retrieve the final result.

## 3.27 Function Hoisting

In JavaScript, both function declarations and function expressions are hoisted, but they behave differently during the hoisting process. Hoisting is a mechanism in JavaScript that moves variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use a function or variable before it's declared in the code, but there are nuances in how function declarations and expressions are hoisted.

**Function Declarations:**

Function declarations are entirely hoisted to the top of their containing scope. This means that both the function name and its body are hoisted.

For example:

```javascript
sayHello(); // This works even before the declaration

function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}
```

In this case, the `sayHello` function declaration is hoisted to the top of the current scope, so you can call it even before the declaration in your code.

**Function Expressions:**

Function expressions behave differently when it comes to hoisting. Only the variable declaration (the name of the variable) is hoisted, not the entire function.

For example:

```javascript
sayHello(); // This will result in an error (sayHello is not a function)

var sayHello = function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
};
```

In this case, the variable `sayHello` is hoisted to the top of its containing scope, but the assignment (the actual function expression) is not hoisted. Therefore, when you try to call `sayHello` before the assignment, it's treated as `undefined`, resulting in an error.

To avoid this issue, it's a good practice to declare and initialize function expressions before using them:

```javascript
var sayHello = function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
};

sayHello(); // This works as expected
```
