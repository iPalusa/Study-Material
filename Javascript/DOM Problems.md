## Promises

Certainly! Here are 10 advanced challenge exercises focused on working with promises in vanilla JavaScript for the frontend. These exercises assume a good understanding of promises and are designed to deepen your knowledge and skills:

1. **Chaining Promises:**
   Create a chain of promises where each subsequent promise depends on the result of the previous one. Use `then` and `catch` to handle the outcomes at each step.

2. **Promise Race:**
   Write a function that takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as the first promise in the array settles.

3. **Promise Timeout:**
   Implement a function that adds a timeout to a promise. If the promise takes longer than a specified time, it should be rejected with a timeout error.

4. **Sequential Execution:**
   Write a function that executes an array of asynchronous tasks sequentially using promises, ensuring that each task completes before the next one starts.

5. **Retry with Backoff:**
   Create a function that wraps another function returning a promise, and automatically retries it with exponential backoff in case of failure.

6. **Promise All with Progress:**
   Enhance the native `Promise.all` to provide progress updates. For example, you should be able to track the completion percentage of all promises.

7. **Custom Promise Implementation:**
   Build a simplified version of the Promise class. Include basic functionalities like `then`, `catch`, and `finally`.

8. **Cancelable Promises:**
   Implement a mechanism to cancel a promise. If a promise is canceled, it should not invoke its resolve or reject callbacks.

9. **Dynamic Parallelism:**
   Write a function that takes an array of tasks and dynamically adjusts the degree of parallelism based on the progress of the tasks.

10. **Promise Memoization:**
    Create a memoization function that caches the result of a promise for a given set of arguments. Subsequent calls with the same arguments should return the cached promise instead of re-executing the operation.

## Call,Apply,Bind

Certainly! Here are five advanced challenge exercises related to `call`, `apply`, and `bind` in vanilla JavaScript for the frontend:

1. **Dynamic Context Switching:**
   Create a function that takes an array of functions and an object. Implement a mechanism that executes each function in the array with the given object as the context, using either `call` or `apply`. The challenge here is to dynamically switch the context for each function.

2. **Partial Application with Bind:**
   Implement a `partial` function that partially applies arguments to a given function using `bind`. The partially applied function should be able to accept additional arguments when it is finally invoked. For example, if you partially apply a function with two arguments, the resulting function should be able to accept the third argument when called.

3. **Function Borrowing:**
   Create a function that allows one object to borrow a method from another object. The function should take two objects and the method name to borrow. The challenge is to use `call` or `apply` to execute the borrowed method with the context of the first object.

4. **Delayed Execution with Apply:**
   Implement a function that delays the execution of another function by a specified amount of time. The delayed function should be invoked with arguments using either `apply` or `call`. Ensure that the original function's context is preserved during the delayed execution.

5. **Currying with Call/Apply:**
   Build a currying function that can curry any given function. The currying function should work with functions of varying arities. It should be able to accept arguments one at a time or all at once and execute the original function appropriately. Use `call` or `apply` to handle the dynamic execution of the curried function.

## Async/Await

Certainly! Working with `async/await` in vanilla JavaScript on the frontend can be challenging, but it's a valuable skill. Here are five advanced challenge exercises to help you strengthen your understanding:

1. **Sequential API Requests:**
   Create a function that performs three asynchronous API requests sequentially. Each request should depend on the result of the previous one. You should handle errors gracefully and use `async/await` to make the code more readable.

2. **Parallel API Requests with Timeout:**
   Write a function that makes three asynchronous API requests in parallel. However, introduce a timeout mechanism so that if any request takes longer than a specified time, it should be considered a failure. Ensure proper error handling and report the results once all requests are complete.

3. **Async Task Queue:**
   Implement a simple task queue that processes asynchronous tasks concurrently but with a maximum concurrency limit. You should be able to dynamically add tasks to the queue, and the queue should execute tasks in parallel, respecting the concurrency limit. Use `async/await` to manage the flow.

4. **Real-time Data Updates:**
   Create a real-time data updating mechanism using async/await. Simulate a scenario where you receive updates from a server at irregular intervals. Use async functions to handle the updates, and ensure that only the latest data is processed while avoiding race conditions.

5. **Custom Promise Implementation:**
   Develop a simplified version of the Promise class using async/await. Create a class with `resolve`, `reject`, and `then` methods. Implement the ability to chain promises and handle errors in a way that mirrors the behavior of native JavaScript promises. This exercise will deepen your understanding of how async/await works under the hood.


## BOM

Certainly! Here are ten advanced challenge exercises related to the Browser Object Model (BOM) in JavaScript for frontend development:

1. **Custom Modal Implementation:**
   Create a custom modal (popup) that can be dynamically generated and controlled using BOM methods. Implement features like opening, closing, and styling.

2. **Dynamic Image Gallery:**
   Build an image gallery that dynamically loads images and allows users to navigate through them. Utilize the BOM to handle events like keyboard shortcuts for navigation.

3. **Resizable and Draggable Elements:**
   Implement resizable and draggable elements on the page using BOM events. Users should be able to resize and move elements freely.

4. **Real-time Clock:**
   Develop a real-time clock that updates every second using the `setInterval` method. Display the current time and update it dynamically on the page.

5. **Browser Geolocation:**
   Create a feature that retrieves the user's geolocation using the Geolocation API. Display the user's latitude and longitude on the page.

6. **Custom Context Menu:**
   Build a custom context menu that appears when users right-click on certain elements. Use BOM events to detect right-clicks and position the menu accordingly.

7. **Offline Support:**
   Implement offline support using the Service Worker API. Create a service worker that caches assets and allows the application to work offline.

8. **Clipboard Manipulation:**
   Develop a feature that allows users to copy and paste content using the clipboard API. Provide a custom context menu with copy and paste options.

9. **Browser Storage Explorer:**
   Build a tool that allows users to explore and manage data stored in different storage areas (localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB) using the BOM.

10. **Cross-browser Compatibility Checker:**
    Create a tool that checks a website's compatibility across different browsers. Use BOM methods to detect the user's browser and highlight potential compatibility issues.
