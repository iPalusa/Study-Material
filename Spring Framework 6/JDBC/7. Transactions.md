# Understanding Transactions:

A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. The key properties of a transaction are often referred to as ACID:

1. **Atomicity:** A transaction is atomic, meaning that it is treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all the changes made in the transaction are committed, or none of them are.

2. **Consistency:** A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. It ensures that the integrity constraints are not violated.

3. **Isolation:** Transactions are isolated from each other. The operations in one transaction are not visible to other transactions until the first transaction is committed.

4. **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive subsequent failures.

# Transaction Isolation Levels:

Isolation levels define the degree to which the operations of one transaction are isolated from the operations of other transactions. The standard isolation levels are:

1. **READ UNCOMMITTED:** Allows transactions to see changes that are not yet committed by other transactions. This level has the lowest isolation.

2. **READ COMMITTED:** Transactions can only see committed changes made by other transactions. This is the default isolation level for many databases.

3. **REPEATABLE READ:** Ensures that if a transaction reads a particular row, subsequent reads in the same transaction will see the same data. It prevents non-repeatable reads.

4. **SERIALIZABLE:** Offers the highest level of isolation. It ensures that even phantom reads (newly inserted rows that match the search condition of a query) do not occur.

Setting the isolation level can be done using the `setTransactionIsolation()` method:

```java
connection.setTransactionIsolation(Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED);
```

# Committing Transactions:

The `commit()` method is used to make the changes made during the current transaction permanent:

```java
try {
    // perform database operations
    connection.commit();
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // handle exception
    connection.rollback(); // Rollback changes if an error occurs
} finally {
    // set auto-commit back to true
    connection.setAutoCommit(true);
}
```

# Rolling Back Transactions:

The `rollback()` method is used to undo the changes made during the current transaction and return to the state before the transaction started:

```java
try {
    // perform database operations
    connection.commit();
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // handle exception
    connection.rollback(); // Rollback changes if an error occurs
} finally {
    // set auto-commit back to true
    connection.setAutoCommit(true);
}
```

Remember to handle exceptions appropriately and ensure that resources are closed properly to avoid potential issues.
