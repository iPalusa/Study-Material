# Executing SQL queries
After establishing a database connection, you can perform SQL operations by creating a `Statement` object and executing SQL queries. Here's an example that demonstrates creating a `Statement` object, executing SQL queries, and handling the results:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class StatementExecutionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // JDBC URL, username, and password of the database
        String jdbcUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
        String username = "your_username";
        String password = "your_password";

        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, username, password)) {
            // Step 1: Create a Statement object
            try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
                // Step 2: Execute SQL queries

                // Example 1: Execute a SELECT query
                String selectQuery = "SELECT * FROM your_table";
                try (ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(selectQuery)) {
                    // Process the result set
                    while (resultSet.next()) {
                        // Retrieve data from the result set
                        int id = resultSet.getInt("id");
                        String name = resultSet.getString("name");

                        // Process the retrieved data
                        System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name);
                    }
                }

                // Example 2: Execute an UPDATE query
                String updateQuery = "UPDATE your_table SET name = 'NewName' WHERE id = 1";
                int rowsUpdated = statement.executeUpdate(updateQuery);
                System.out.println(rowsUpdated + " rows updated.");

                // Example 3: Execute an INSERT query
                String insertQuery = "INSERT INTO your_table (name) VALUES ('NewEntry')";
                int rowsInserted = statement.executeUpdate(insertQuery);
                System.out.println(rowsInserted + " rows inserted.");
            }

        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Handle SQL-related exceptions
            System.err.println("SQL Error: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- Replace `"your_database"`, `"your_username"`, `"your_password"`, and `"your_table"` with your actual database name, username, password, and table name.
- The `Statement` object is created using `connection.createStatement()`. The basic Statement interface is used for executing simple SQL queries without parameters. It is generally used for queries that do not involve input from the user.
- The `executeQuery` method is used for SELECT queries, and the result set is processed in a `while` loop.
- The `executeUpdate` method is used for UPDATE and INSERT queries, and it returns the number of rows affected.

# Executing SQL DML statements

DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements in SQL include operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. To execute SQL DML statements in Java using JDBC, you can use the `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` interfaces. Below are examples for each type of DML operation:

## 1. **INSERT Statement:**
   - Inserting data into a table.

   ```java
   import java.sql.Connection;
   import java.sql.DriverManager;
   import java.sql.SQLException;
   import java.sql.Statement;

   public class InsertExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String jdbcUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
           String username = "your_username";
           String password = "your_password";

           try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, username, password)) {
               // Creating a Statement object
               try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
                   // Example INSERT statement
                   String insertQuery = "INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES ('value1', 'value2')";
                   int rowsInserted = statement.executeUpdate(insertQuery);

                   System.out.println(rowsInserted + " rows inserted.");
               }
           } catch (SQLException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## 2. **UPDATE Statement:**
   - Updating existing data in a table.

   ```java
   import java.sql.Connection;
   import java.sql.DriverManager;
   import java.sql.SQLException;
   import java.sql.Statement;

   public class UpdateExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String jdbcUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
           String username = "your_username";
           String password = "your_password";

           try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, username, password)) {
               // Creating a Statement object
               try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
                   // Example UPDATE statement
                   String updateQuery = "UPDATE your_table SET column1 = 'new_value' WHERE column2 = 'some_condition'";
                   int rowsUpdated = statement.executeUpdate(updateQuery);

                   System.out.println(rowsUpdated + " rows updated.");
               }
           } catch (SQLException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## 3. **DELETE Statement:**
   - Deleting data from a table.

   ```java
   import java.sql.Connection;
   import java.sql.DriverManager;
   import java.sql.SQLException;
   import java.sql.Statement;

   public class DeleteExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String jdbcUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
           String username = "your_username";
           String password = "your_password";

           try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, username, password)) {
               // Creating a Statement object
               try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
                   // Example DELETE statement
                   String deleteQuery = "DELETE FROM your_table WHERE column1 = 'some_condition'";
                   int rowsDeleted = statement.executeUpdate(deleteQuery);

                   System.out.println(rowsDeleted + " rows deleted.");
               }
           } catch (SQLException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

Ensure you replace placeholders like `"your_database"`, `"your_username"`, `"your_password"`, `"your_table"`, `"column1"`, and `"column2"` with your actual database, username, password, table, and column names. Also, handle exceptions appropriately for robust error handling.

# Handling SQL exceptions
When working with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), it is important to handle SQL exceptions to ensure robust and error-tolerant database interactions. SQLException is the main exception class in JDBC that represents database-related errors. Here are some common strategies for handling SQL exceptions in JDBC:

## 1. **Use try-catch blocks:**
   Surround your JDBC code with try-catch blocks to catch SQLExceptions and handle them appropriately. You can catch specific types of exceptions or catch the general SQLException.

   ```java
   Connection connection = null;
   PreparedStatement preparedStatement = null;
   ResultSet resultSet = null;

   try {
       // JDBC code here
   } catch (SQLException e) {
       // Handle the exception
       e.printStackTrace(); // or log the exception
   } finally {
       // Close resources in the finally block
   }
   ```

## 2. **Print or log the exception information:**
   When catching SQLException, it's a good practice to log or print the exception information. This helps in diagnosing issues during development and troubleshooting in production.

   ```java
   catch (SQLException e) {
       // Log the exception
       e.printStackTrace(); // or use a logging framework like Log4j
   }
   ```

## 3. **Handle specific SQL states:**
Handling specific SQL states in JDBC allows you to customize your exception handling based on the specific error conditions that occur during database interactions. The `SQLState` is a five-character alphanumeric code that represents the error or exception condition. Each database vendor may define its own set of SQL states for various error scenarios. By checking the SQL state, you can take different actions for different types of errors. Here's an explanation of how to handle specific SQL states in JDBC:

### 1. **Get SQL State from SQLException:**
   The `SQLState` can be obtained from the `SQLException` object using the `getSQLState()` method.

   ```java
   catch (SQLException e) {
       String sqlState = e.getSQLState();
       // Handle the exception based on the SQL state
   }
   ```

### 2. **Example - Handle Duplicate Key Violation:**
   Consider a scenario where you want to handle a unique constraint violation, such as a duplicate key in a primary key column.

   ```java
   catch (SQLException e) {
       if ("23505".equals(e.getSQLState())) {
           // Handle unique constraint violation (SQL state 23505)
           System.out.println("Duplicate key found!");
       } else {
           // Handle other cases
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, "23505" is a common SQL state used by many databases to indicate a unique constraint violation. You can find the specific SQL states for your database in its documentation.

### 3. **Example - Handle Foreign Key Violation:**
   Another example could be handling a foreign key violation.

   ```java
   catch (SQLException e) {
       if ("23503".equals(e.getSQLState())) {
           // Handle foreign key violation (SQL state 23503)
           System.out.println("Foreign key constraint violated!");
       } else {
           // Handle other cases
       }
   }
   ```

   In this case, "23503" is a common SQL state for foreign key constraint violations.

### 4. **Generic Handling for Unknown States:**
   If you don't want to handle specific SQL states, you can use a more generic approach and log or print the SQL state for diagnostic purposes.

   ```java
   catch (SQLException e) {
       String sqlState = e.getSQLState();
       System.out.println("Unhandled SQL state: " + sqlState);
       // Handle the exception in a generic way or rethrow it
   }
   ```

   This helps in identifying unexpected or unknown errors during development and allows for more detailed troubleshooting.

## 4. **Handle specific error codes:**
Handling specific error codes in JDBC allows you to take different actions based on the type of error that occurred. The error code is a numeric value associated with a particular type of exception. Here's how you can handle specific error codes in JDBC:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class JDBCHandlingErrorCodes {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Connection connection = null;
        PreparedStatement preparedStatement = null;

        try {
            // JDBC code that may cause an exception
            connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database", "username", "password");
            preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (?, ?)");

            // Set values for the prepared statement
            preparedStatement.setString(1, "value1");
            preparedStatement.setString(2, "value2");

            // Execute the query
            preparedStatement.executeUpdate();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            handleSQLException(e);
        } finally {
            // Close resources in the finally block
            try {
                if (preparedStatement != null) preparedStatement.close();
                if (connection != null) connection.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace(); // Handle closing exception
            }
        }
    }

    private static void handleSQLException(SQLException e) {
        int errorCode = e.getErrorCode();
        System.out.println("Error Code: " + errorCode);

        switch (errorCode) {
            case 1062:
                // Handle duplicate key violation
                System.out.println("Duplicate key violation. Handle accordingly.");
                break;
            case 1400:
                // Handle integrity constraint violation
                System.out.println("Integrity constraint violation. Handle accordingly.");
                break;
            // Add more cases as needed for specific error codes
            default:
                // Handle other cases
                System.out.println("Unhandled error code. Handle accordingly.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `handleSQLException` method is used to centralize the logic for handling SQLExceptions. The `getErrorCode()` method of SQLException returns the vendor-specific error code associated with the exception. You can then use a switch statement to check for specific error codes and take appropriate actions based on the type of error.

In the example, two specific error codes (1062 and 1400) are shown as examples, but you should customize the handling based on the specific requirements of your application and the database you are working with. You can find documentation for the error codes in the database's documentation or JDBC driver documentation.

## 5. **Rollback transactions:**
Rolling back a transaction in the context of database operations means undoing or reverting the changes made during the transaction. Transactions in a database are a series of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. If an error occurs during the execution of any statement within the transaction, you may want to roll back the entire transaction to maintain data consistency and integrity.

Here's a more detailed explanation of rolling back transactions in JDBC:

### 1. **Transaction Structure:**
   - Transactions typically follow a structure like this:
     ```java
     Connection connection = null;
     try {
         connection.setAutoCommit(false); // Disable auto-commit mode

         // Execute SQL statements as part of the transaction

         connection.commit(); // If all statements are successful, commit the transaction
     } catch (SQLException e) {
         connection.rollback(); // If an exception occurs, roll back the transaction
     } finally {
         connection.setAutoCommit(true); // Enable auto-commit mode again
         connection.close(); // Close the connection in the finally block
     }
     ```

### 2. **Setting Auto-Commit Mode:**
   - By default, a JDBC connection is in auto-commit mode, where each SQL statement is treated as a separate transaction and is automatically committed. To manage transactions explicitly, you can disable auto-commit mode using `setAutoCommit(false)`.

### 3. **Committing the Transaction:**
   - If all SQL statements within the transaction execute successfully, you commit the transaction using `connection.commit()`. This makes the changes permanent in the database.

### 4. **Rolling Back the Transaction:**
   - If an exception occurs during the transaction (e.g., SQLException), you roll back the entire transaction using `connection.rollback()`. This undoes any changes made within the transaction, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state.

   ```java
   catch (SQLException e) {
       connection.rollback(); // Roll back the transaction in case of an exception
       e.printStackTrace(); // Handle the exception
   }
   ```

### 5. **Enabling Auto-Commit Again:**
   - After committing or rolling back the transaction, it's important to re-enable auto-commit mode to allow subsequent statements outside the transaction to be committed automatically.

   ```java
   finally {
       connection.setAutoCommit(true); // Enable auto-commit mode again
       connection.close(); // Close the connection in the finally block
   }
   ```

Rolling back transactions is a crucial aspect of database management, as it ensures that the database remains in a consistent state even when errors occur during transaction execution. It helps maintain the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties of database transactions.

## 6. **Close resources in the finally block:**
Closing resources in the `finally` block is a best practice in Java, and it ensures that resources are properly released regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. In the context of JDBC, resources commonly include instances of `Connection`, `Statement`, and `ResultSet`. These resources must be closed to free up database and system resources and avoid potential memory leaks.

Here's an explanation of closing resources in the `finally` block:

```java
Connection connection = null;
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = null;
ResultSet resultSet = null;

try {
    // JDBC code here
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // Handle the exception
    e.printStackTrace(); // or log the exception
} finally {
    // Close resources in the finally block
    try {
        if (resultSet != null) resultSet.close();
        if (preparedStatement != null) preparedStatement.close();
        if (connection != null) connection.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace(); // Handle closing exception
    }
}
```

Explanation:

### 1. **Connection, PreparedStatement, ResultSet Initialization:**
   - `Connection`, `PreparedStatement`, and `ResultSet` instances are initialized outside the `try` block to make sure they are visible in the `finally` block.

### 2. **Try Block (JDBC Code):**
   - The JDBC code is placed inside the `try` block. This is where you execute SQL statements, perform queries, and handle database operations.

### 3. **Catch Block (Exception Handling):**
   - The `catch` block catches any `SQLException` that might occur during the execution of JDBC code. You can handle exceptions, print error messages, or log them for further analysis.

### 4. **Finally Block (Resource Cleanup):**
   - The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. This block is crucial for resource cleanup.
   - Each resource (ResultSet, PreparedStatement, Connection) is checked for `null` before attempting to close it. This is important to avoid `NullPointerException` if a resource was never initialized or if it was closed inside the `try` block.
   - The `close()` method is called on each resource to release associated database and system resources.
   - Any `SQLException` that occurs during resource closing is caught and can be handled. This ensures that even if there is an issue closing the resources, the application doesn't crash, and the exception is logged or handled appropriately.

By closing resources in the `finally` block, you ensure that they are properly released, improving the robustness and reliability of your JDBC code. This practice is especially important when dealing with database connections to prevent resource leaks and optimize resource usage.
