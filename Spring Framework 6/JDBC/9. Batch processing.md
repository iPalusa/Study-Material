Working with batches in JDBC allows you to group multiple SQL statements and execute them together, which can improve performance by reducing the number of round-trips to the database. Here's a guide on how to add SQL statements to a batch, execute the batch, and handle exceptions:

# Adding SQL Statements to a Batch:

## 1. **Creating a Statement object:**
   - To add statements to a batch, you first need to create a `Statement` object. This can be a `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, or `CallableStatement` depending on the type of SQL statements you want to execute.

   ```java
   Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
   ```

## 2. **Adding statements to the batch:**
   - Use the `addBatch()` method to add SQL statements to the batch.

   ```java
   statement.addBatch("INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2)");
   statement.addBatch("UPDATE your_table SET column1 = value WHERE condition");
   // Add other statements as needed
   ```

# Executing a Batch:

## 3. **Executing the batch:**
   - Use the `executeBatch()` method to execute the batch.

   ```java
   int[] updateCounts = statement.executeBatch();
   ```

   - The method returns an array of integers representing the update counts for each statement in the batch. The values can be used to determine the success of each statement.

# Handling Exceptions:

## 4. **Handling exceptions:**
   - Wrap the batch execution in a try-catch block to handle any potential exceptions.

   ```java
   try {
       int[] updateCounts = statement.executeBatch();
       // Process update counts if needed
   } catch (SQLException e) {
       e.printStackTrace(); // Handle the exception (log it or take appropriate action)
   } finally {
       // Close resources in the finally block
       if (statement != null) {
           statement.close();
       }
   ```

   - Common exceptions include `SQLException`, so it's essential to handle them to ensure proper error management.

## 5. **Closing resources:**
   - Close the `Statement` in the `finally` block to release resources.

   ```java
   if (statement != null) {
       statement.close();
   }
   ```

### Example:

Here's a more complete example:

```java
Statement statement = null;

try {
    statement = connection.createStatement();

    statement.addBatch("INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2)");
    statement.addBatch("UPDATE your_table SET column1 = value WHERE condition");

    int[] updateCounts = statement.executeBatch();

    // Process update counts if needed
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace(); // Handle the exception (log it or take appropriate action)
} finally {
    // Close resources in the finally block
    if (statement != null) {
        statement.close();
    }
}
```

Remember to adapt the code based on the specific SQL statements you want to execute in the batch and handle exceptions appropriately for your application's requirements.

# Methods

Batch processing in JDBC involves executing multiple SQL statements in a single batch, which can improve performance by reducing the number of round-trips to the database. The `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement` interfaces provide methods for working with batches. Here is a list of commonly used batch processing methods:

### Common Batch Processing Methods:

1. **`addBatch(String sql)` (in `Statement`):**
   - Adds the given SQL statement to the current batch.

2. **`addBatch()` (in `PreparedStatement` and `CallableStatement`):**
   - Adds the set of parameters to the current batch. This method is used after setting the parameters for a prepared statement or callable statement.

3. **`executeBatch()` (in `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement`):**
   - Executes the batch of commands and returns an array of update counts, indicating the number of affected rows for each statement in the batch.

4. **`clearBatch()` (in `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement`):**
   - Clears the current batch, discarding any statements that have been added so far.

### Example:

Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of batch processing with a `PreparedStatement`:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class BatchProcessingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String jdbcUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdatabase";
        String username = "yourUsername";
        String password = "yourPassword";

        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, username, password)) {
            // Assume 'your_table' has columns 'column1' and 'column2'
            String sql = "INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (?, ?)";

            try (PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {
                // Add statements to the batch
                for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                    preparedStatement.setInt(1, i);
                    preparedStatement.setString(2, "Value " + i);
                    preparedStatement.addBatch();
                }

                // Execute the batch
                int[] updateCounts = preparedStatement.executeBatch();

                // Process update counts or handle any other logic
                for (int updateCount : updateCounts) {
                    System.out.println("Rows affected: " + updateCount);
                }
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, five sets of parameters are added to the batch, and then `executeBatch()` is called to execute them together. The `updateCounts` array contains the number of affected rows for each statement in the batch.

Remember to handle exceptions and close resources appropriately. Batch processing is beneficial for improving performance, especially when dealing with multiple similar operations.
