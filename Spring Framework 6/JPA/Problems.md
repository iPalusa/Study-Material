1. **Entity Relationships:** Create a JPA model with complex entity relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many associations, and explore the use of cascading operations.

2. **Inheritance Mapping:** Implement different strategies for mapping inheritance hierarchies in JPA, such as single table, joined table, and table-per-class, understanding the trade-offs of each approach.

3. **Embeddable Types:** Utilize embeddable types to model complex entities that consist of multiple components, demonstrating how to map them in JPA and handle cascading updates.

4. **JPQL Queries:** Write complex JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) queries involving multiple entities, aggregations, and joins, demonstrating proficiency in querying data using JPA.

5. **Criteria API Usage:** Implement dynamic queries using the JPA Criteria API, allowing for programmatic and type-safe construction of queries without resorting to JPQL.

6. **Secondary Tables:** Utilize secondary tables to map additional attributes or relationships for an entity, demonstrating how to manage multiple tables for a single entity.

7. **Versioning and Optimistic Locking:** Implement versioning and optimistic locking to handle concurrent updates to entities, ensuring data consistency and preventing conflicts.

8. **Batch Processing with JPA:** Develop a batch processing system using JPA for efficient bulk inserts, updates, or deletes, optimizing performance for large datasets.

9. **Listeners and Callbacks:** Implement entity listeners and lifecycle callbacks to perform custom actions before or after certain JPA lifecycle events, such as persisting, updating, or removing entities.

10. **Named Queries:** Utilize named queries to encapsulate and reuse commonly used queries, promoting code maintainability and readability.

11. **Custom Repositories:** Extend and customize JPA repositories with custom query methods and repository interfaces, showcasing advanced querying capabilities.

12. **Auditing with JPA:** Implement auditing features to track and log changes to entities, capturing information such as who made the change and when it occurred.

13. **Mapping Enums in JPA:** Explore different approaches for mapping enums in JPA entities, considering the use of ordinal values, string values, or custom enum types.

14. **Lazy Loading and Eager Fetching:** Manage entity fetching strategies, balancing between lazy loading and eager fetching to optimize performance and avoid unnecessary data retrieval.

15. **Caching Strategies:** Implement and configure caching mechanisms in JPA, exploring both first-level (session) and second-level (shared) caching to improve application performance.
