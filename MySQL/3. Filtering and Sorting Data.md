1. **Basic Filtering:**
   - WHERE clause and its operators (e.g., =, <>, >, <, BETWEEN, IN)
   - Logical operators (e.g., AND, OR, NOT)
   - LIKE operator for pattern matching
   - IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators

2. **Sorting Data:**
   - ORDER BY clause for sorting data in ascending or descending order
   - Sorting by multiple columns
   - Sorting by expressions or functions

3. **Advanced Filtering:**
   - Conditional filtering with CASE statement
   - Filtering with NULL-safe equality operator (<=>)
   - Filtering using regular expressions with REGEXP and RLIKE

4. **Set Operators:**
   - UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT (MINUS) for combining and filtering result sets

5. **LIMIT and OFFSET:**
   - Using LIMIT to restrict the number of rows returned
   - Using OFFSET for pagination and skipping rows

6. **Pattern Matching:**
   - Regular expressions in SQL using REGEXP and RLIKE
   - Pattern matching with wildcards (%, _)

7. **Date and Time Filtering:**
   - Filtering data based on date and time values
   - Date and time functions for extracting components (YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, etc.)

8. **Advanced Sorting Techniques:**
   - Sorting NULL values (NULLS FIRST, NULLS LAST)
   - Sorting using custom collations
   - Sorting based on expressions or functions

9. **Using Subqueries for Filtering:**
   - Subqueries in the WHERE clause for filtering data based on the result of another query
   - Scalar subqueries, row subqueries, and table subqueries for filtering

10. **Dynamic Filtering:**
    - Filtering based on dynamic conditions using dynamic SQL and prepared statements
