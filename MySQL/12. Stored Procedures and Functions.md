# 1. **Introduction to Stored Procedures and Functions:**
## Definition and purpose of stored procedures and functions.
Stored procedures and functions are database objects that contain a set of SQL statements and/or control-flow statements, which are stored and can be executed within the database management system (DBMS). They serve several purposes and offer various benefits in database development and management.

### Definition:

1. **Stored Procedure:**
   - A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that have been compiled and stored in the database. It can accept input parameters, perform operations such as data manipulation or retrieval, and return results.

2. **Function:**
   - A function is a database object that encapsulates a set of SQL statements and returns a single value. It can be used within SQL statements like any other expression.

### Purpose:

1. **Modularity and Reusability:**
   - Stored procedures and functions promote modularity by encapsulating complex logic into reusable units. They allow developers to define common operations once and reuse them across multiple applications or queries, improving code maintainability and reducing duplication.

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Stored procedures and functions can enhance performance by reducing network traffic. Since they are executed directly within the database engine, they minimize the overhead associated with executing multiple SQL statements over the network.

3. **Security and Access Control:**
   - Stored procedures and functions provide a layer of security by allowing controlled access to database functionality. Permissions can be granted or revoked at the procedure level, restricting users' ability to interact with underlying data directly.

4. **Data Integrity and Consistency:**
   - By encapsulating data manipulation logic within stored procedures, database administrators can enforce data integrity rules and ensure consistency across the database. This helps maintain data quality and prevents unauthorized modifications.

5. **Encapsulation of Business Logic:**
   - Business logic can be encapsulated within stored procedures and functions, allowing developers to centralize and manage complex business rules within the database. This separation of concerns facilitates easier maintenance and updates to business logic without impacting application code.

6. **Transaction Control:**
   - Stored procedures can control transactions explicitly, allowing developers to define transaction boundaries and ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) across multiple SQL statements.

7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Stored procedures and functions offer a level of abstraction from underlying database implementations. This allows applications to remain relatively unaffected by changes in the database platform, promoting cross-platform compatibility and portability.

## Advantages of using stored procedures and functions.
Using stored procedures and functions in database development offers several advantages:

1. **Improved Performance:**
   - Stored procedures and functions are compiled and stored in the database, reducing the overhead of parsing and optimizing SQL statements repeatedly. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for frequently executed operations.

2. **Reduced Network Traffic:**
   - Since stored procedures and functions are executed directly within the database server, they minimize the amount of data transferred over the network. This can result in lower network latency and improved application responsiveness, particularly in distributed environments.

3. **Enhanced Security:**
   - Stored procedures and functions provide a layer of security by allowing controlled access to database functionality. Permissions can be granted at the procedure level, restricting users' ability to interact with underlying data directly and preventing unauthorized access.

4. **Modularity and Code Reusability:**
   - Stored procedures and functions promote modularity by encapsulating complex logic into reusable units. Developers can define common operations once and reuse them across multiple applications or queries, reducing code duplication and improving code maintainability.

5. **Encapsulation of Business Logic:**
   - Business logic can be encapsulated within stored procedures and functions, allowing developers to centralize and manage complex business rules within the database. This separation of concerns facilitates easier maintenance and updates to business logic without impacting application code.

6. **Data Integrity and Consistency:**
   - Stored procedures can enforce data integrity rules and ensure consistency across the database by encapsulating data manipulation logic. This helps maintain data quality and prevents unauthorized modifications, improving overall data reliability.

7. **Transaction Management:**
   - Stored procedures allow developers to define transaction boundaries explicitly, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) across multiple SQL statements. This facilitates robust transaction management and helps maintain database integrity.

8. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Stored procedures and functions offer a level of abstraction from underlying database implementations. This allows applications to remain relatively unaffected by changes in the database platform, promoting cross-platform compatibility and portability.

9. **Centralized Maintenance and Updates:**
   - By encapsulating logic within stored procedures and functions, developers can centralize maintenance and updates to database functionality. This simplifies the process of making changes and ensures consistency across applications that rely on the same database logic.

# 2. **Creating Stored Procedures:**
## Syntax for creating stored procedures.
The syntax for creating stored procedures in SQL varies slightly between different database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc. Here, I'll provide a general syntax for creating stored procedures in SQL:

### MySQL Syntax:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (parameter_list)
    [characteristics]
    SQL_STATEMENT;
```

- `CREATE PROCEDURE`: This keyword is used to begin the definition of a new stored procedure.

- `procedure_name`: This is the name of the stored procedure you are creating.

- `parameter_list`: This is an optional list of input parameters that the stored procedure can accept. Parameters are separated by commas and defined using the `parameter_name` followed by the data type.

- `characteristics`: This optional part includes characteristics such as `DETERMINISTIC`, `LANGUAGE SQL`, `CONTAINS SQL`, `NO SQL`, `READS SQL DATA`, `MODIFIES SQL DATA`, etc. It defines the behavior of the stored procedure.

- `SQL_STATEMENT`: This is the SQL code block that defines the logic of the stored procedure. It can contain any valid SQL statements, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, control flow statements, variable declarations, etc.

### Example:

Here's an example of creating a simple stored procedure in MySQL:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCount()
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

In this example:
- The stored procedure is named `GetEmployeeCount`.
- It does not accept any parameters.
- The SQL statement inside the procedure selects the count of rows from the `employees` table and assigns it to the alias `total_employees`.
- The `DELIMITER` statements are used to change the delimiter temporarily to `//` to allow the use of semicolons (`;`) inside the procedure definition.

## Parameters and variables in stored procedures.
In stored procedures, parameters and variables play a crucial role in passing values, performing operations, and controlling the flow of logic. Here's an overview of parameters and variables in stored procedures:

### Parameters:

Parameters are placeholders for values that are passed into a stored procedure when it is called. They allow for dynamic input and customization of stored procedure behavior. Parameters can be of two types:

1. **Input Parameters (IN):**
   - Input parameters are used to pass values into the stored procedure from outside. They are read-only within the procedure and cannot be modified.
   - Syntax: `IN parameter_name data_type`

2. **Output Parameters (OUT):**
   - Output parameters are used to return values from the stored procedure back to the caller. They are write-only within the procedure and must be explicitly assigned a value before the procedure exits.
   - Syntax: `OUT parameter_name data_type`

3. **Input/Output Parameters (INOUT):**
   - Input/output parameters allow for bidirectional data flow. They can be read from and written to within the stored procedure.
   - Syntax: `INOUT parameter_name data_type`

### Variables:

Variables are used to store and manipulate data within the stored procedure's logic. They can hold various data types and can be declared and assigned values within the procedure. Variables are scoped to the procedure in which they are declared and are only accessible within that scope.

#### Syntax for Variable Declaration:

```sql
DECLARE variable_name data_type [DEFAULT initial_value];
```

#### Example:

```sql
DECLARE emp_count INT DEFAULT 0;
```

In this example, `emp_count` is a variable of type `INT` with an initial value of `0`.

### Example of Using Parameters and Variables:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails(IN emp_id INT, OUT emp_name VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
    DECLARE emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2);
    
    -- Retrieve employee details
    SELECT salary INTO emp_salary FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id;
    
    -- Assign employee name to output parameter
    SELECT name INTO emp_name FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id;
    
    -- Output employee details
    SELECT emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary;
END;
```

In this example:
- `emp_id` is an input parameter used to specify the employee ID whose details are to be retrieved.
- `emp_name` is an output parameter used to return the employee name to the caller.
- `emp_salary` is a local variable used to store the employee's salary retrieved from the database.

## Executing basic stored procedures.
To execute a basic stored procedure in a MySQL database, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Create the Stored Procedure:**
   First, create the stored procedure in your MySQL database using the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement. Here's an example of a simple stored procedure that selects all records from a table:

   ```sql
   DELIMITER //

   CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllEmployees()
   BEGIN
       SELECT * FROM employees;
   END //

   DELIMITER ;
   ```

### 2. **Call the Stored Procedure:**
   Once the stored procedure is created, you can call it using the `CALL` statement. Here's how to call the `SelectAllEmployees` stored procedure:

   ```sql
   CALL SelectAllEmployees();
   ```

   When you execute this statement, it will invoke the stored procedure, and the SQL statements within the procedure will be executed.

### 3. **View the Results:**
   After calling the stored procedure, you can view the results returned by the procedure. If the procedure selects data from a table, the result set will be displayed in your MySQL client.

   For example, if the `SelectAllEmployees` procedure selects all records from the `employees` table, you'll see the records displayed in your MySQL client's output.

# 3. **Creating Functions:**
## Syntax for creating functions.
Creating functions in SQL databases allows you to encapsulate logic and calculations that can be reused within SQL statements. Here's the general syntax for creating functions:

### SQL Syntax:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION function_name (parameter_list)
RETURNS return_data_type
[characteristics]
BEGIN
    -- Function body with SQL statements
END;
```

- `CREATE FUNCTION`: This keyword is used to define a new function.

- `function_name`: This is the name of the function you are creating.

- `parameter_list`: This is an optional list of input parameters that the function can accept. Parameters are separated by commas and defined using the `parameter_name` followed by the data type.

- `RETURNS`: This keyword specifies the data type of the value returned by the function.

- `return_data_type`: This is the data type of the value returned by the function.

- `characteristics`: This optional part includes characteristics such as `DETERMINISTIC`, `LANGUAGE SQL`, `CONTAINS SQL`, `NO SQL`, `READS SQL DATA`, `MODIFIES SQL DATA`, etc. It defines the behavior of the function.

- `BEGIN` and `END`: These keywords enclose the body of the function, which contains the SQL statements defining the function's logic.

### Example:

Here's an example of creating a simple function in MySQL that calculates the square of a number:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION Square(num INT) 
RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    RETURN num * num;
END;
```

In this example:
- The function is named `Square`.
- It accepts one input parameter `num` of type `INT`.
- It returns an integer value, which is the square of the input parameter `num`.
- The function body calculates the square of the input parameter and returns the result using the `RETURN` keyword.

## Different types of functions (scalar, table-valued, etc.).
In SQL databases, functions are categorized into different types based on their behavior and the nature of their return values. Here are the main types of functions commonly found in SQL:

### 1. Scalar Functions:
   - Scalar functions return a single value based on the input parameters provided.
   - They can accept zero or more input parameters and return a single scalar value.
   - Examples include functions that perform mathematical calculations, string manipulations, date/time operations, etc.

### 2. Table-Valued Functions (TVFs):
   - Table-valued functions return a set of rows as a result set, similar to a table.
   - They can accept input parameters and return a table-like structure containing multiple rows and columns.
   - TVFs can be used in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement, making them useful for complex queries and data manipulation.
   - Examples include inline table-valued functions and multi-statement table-valued functions.

### 3. Aggregate Functions:
   - Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single aggregated result.
   - They are typically used with the GROUP BY clause to calculate summary statistics such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, etc.
   - Aggregate functions operate on a group of rows and return a single value for each group.

### 4. Window Functions:
   - Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, known as the window or partition.
   - They are used to calculate aggregated values, ranking, and row numbering within a specific window of rows.
   - Window functions are often used in conjunction with the OVER clause to define the window specification.

### 5. System Functions:
   - System functions are built-in functions provided by the database management system (DBMS) for performing various tasks.
   - They include functions for date and time manipulation, string operations, type conversion, etc.
   - System functions are typically available for use without the need for explicit declaration or definition.

### 6. User-Defined Functions (UDFs):
   - User-defined functions are functions created by users to encapsulate custom logic or calculations.
   - They can be scalar functions, table-valued functions, or aggregate functions defined by users according to their specific requirements.
   - UDFs provide flexibility and reusability in SQL code, allowing users to extend the functionality of the database system.

## Returning values from functions.
Returning values from functions in SQL depends on the type of function being used. Here's how values are returned from different types of functions:

### 1. Scalar Functions:
   - Scalar functions return a single value.
   - The return value is specified using the `RETURN` keyword within the function body.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION AddNumbers(a INT, b INT) RETURNS INT
     BEGIN
         DECLARE result INT;
         SET result = a + b;
         RETURN result;
     END;
     ```

### 2. Table-Valued Functions (TVFs):
   - Table-valued functions return a table-like result set.
   - The result set is typically generated by querying data within the function body.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDepartment(department_id INT) RETURNS TABLE
     BEGIN
         RETURN (SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = department_id);
     END;
     ```

### 3. Aggregate Functions:
   - Aggregate functions return a single aggregated value based on a set of input values.
   - The return value is specified as part of the SELECT statement where the aggregate function is used.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
     ```

### 4. Window Functions:
   - Window functions return values based on calculations performed over a window or partition of rows.
   - The return value is specified as part of the SELECT statement where the window function is used.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, salary, 
            AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS department_average_salary
     FROM employees;
     ```

### 5. System Functions:
   - System functions return values based on predefined operations or calculations provided by the database management system.
   - The return value is typically used directly in SQL statements where the system function is invoked.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT CURRENT_DATE() AS current_date;
     ```

### 6. User-Defined Functions (UDFs):
   - User-defined functions return values based on custom logic defined by users.
   - The return value is specified using the `RETURN` keyword within the function body for scalar functions, or the function body generates the result set for table-valued functions.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION MultiplyNumbers(a INT, b INT) RETURNS INT
     BEGIN
         DECLARE result INT;
         SET result = a * b;
         RETURN result;
     END;
     ```

# 4. **Parameters in Procedures and Functions:**
## Input parameters.
Input parameters in SQL functions allow you to pass values into the function for processing. Here's how input parameters are defined and used in different types of SQL functions:

### 1. Scalar Functions:
   - Scalar functions can accept zero or more input parameters.
   - Input parameters are defined within the parentheses following the function name.
   - Parameters can have different data types.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION AddNumbers(a INT, b INT) RETURNS INT
     BEGIN
         DECLARE result INT;
         SET result = a + b;
         RETURN result;
     END;
     ```
   - In this example, the `AddNumbers` function accepts two input parameters `a` and `b` of type `INT`.

### 2. Table-Valued Functions (TVFs):
   - Table-valued functions can also accept zero or more input parameters.
   - Input parameters are defined within the parentheses following the function name.
   - Parameters can have different data types.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDepartment(department_id INT) RETURNS TABLE
     BEGIN
         RETURN (SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = department_id);
     END;
     ```
   - In this example, the `GetEmployeesByDepartment` function accepts one input parameter `department_id` of type `INT`.

### 3. Aggregate Functions:
   - Aggregate functions typically do not accept input parameters directly.
   - They operate on a set of input values derived from the SELECT statement.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
     ```
   - In this example, the `AVG` aggregate function calculates the average salary from the `salary` column of the `employees` table.

### 4. Window Functions:
   - Window functions can also accept zero or more input parameters.
   - Parameters are defined within the function call, typically within the OVER clause.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, salary, 
            AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS department_average_salary
     FROM employees;
     ```
   - In this example, the `AVG` window function operates on the `salary` column, partitioned by `department_id`.

### 5. System Functions:
   - System functions typically do not accept input parameters directly.
   - They perform predefined operations or calculations provided by the database management system.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT CURRENT_DATE() AS current_date;
     ```
   - In this example, the `CURRENT_DATE` system function returns the current date.

### 6. User-Defined Functions (UDFs):
   - User-defined functions can accept zero or more input parameters.
   - Parameters are defined within the parentheses following the function name.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION MultiplyNumbers(a INT, b INT) RETURNS INT
     BEGIN
         DECLARE result INT;
         SET result = a * b;
         RETURN result;
     END;
     ```
   - In this example, the `MultiplyNumbers` function accepts two input parameters `a` and `b` of type `INT`.

## Output parameters.
Output parameters in SQL functions allow you to return values from the function back to the caller. Here's how output parameters are defined and used in different types of SQL functions:

### 1. Scalar Functions:
   - Scalar functions can return a single value as their result.
   - The returned value is specified using the `RETURN` keyword within the function body.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeeName(employee_id INT) RETURNS VARCHAR(50)
     BEGIN
         DECLARE emp_name VARCHAR(50);
         SELECT name INTO emp_name FROM employees WHERE id = employee_id;
         RETURN emp_name;
     END;
     ```
   - In this example, the `GetEmployeeName` function returns the name of an employee based on the provided `employee_id`.

### 2. Table-Valued Functions (TVFs):
   - Table-valued functions return a table-like result set.
   - The result set is generated by querying data within the function body.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDepartment(department_id INT) RETURNS TABLE
     BEGIN
         RETURN (SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = department_id);
     END;
     ```
   - In this example, the `GetEmployeesByDepartment` function returns a result set containing employees from a specific department.

### 3. Aggregate Functions:
   - Aggregate functions return a single aggregated value based on a set of input values.
   - The aggregated value is returned directly as part of the SELECT statement where the aggregate function is used.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
     ```
   - In this example, the `AVG` aggregate function returns the average salary of employees.

### 4. Window Functions:
   - Window functions operate on a set of rows related to the current row (window or partition).
   - They typically do not return output parameters directly; instead, they return values as part of the result set.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, salary, 
            AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS department_average_salary
     FROM employees;
     ```
   - In this example, the `AVG` window function calculates the average salary for each department as part of the result set.

### 5. System Functions:
   - System functions typically do not return output parameters directly.
   - They perform predefined operations or calculations provided by the database management system.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT CURRENT_DATE() AS current_date;
     ```
   - In this example, the `CURRENT_DATE` system function returns the current date as part of the result set.

### 6. User-Defined Functions (UDFs):
   - User-defined functions can return values using output parameters.
   - Output parameters are defined within the function declaration and can be assigned values within the function body.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION AddNumbers(a INT, b INT, OUT result INT) 
     BEGIN
         SET result = a + b;
     END;
     ```
   - In this example, the `AddNumbers` function calculates the sum of two numbers and returns the result through the `result` output parameter.

## Default parameter values.
Default parameter values in SQL functions allow you to specify a default value for parameters in case no value is provided during the function call. Here's how default parameter values are defined and used in different types of SQL functions:

### 1. Scalar Functions:
   - In scalar functions, default parameter values are specified within the parameter list when defining the function.
   - When a default value is specified for a parameter, it is used if no value is provided during the function call.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION MultiplyNumbers(a INT, b INT DEFAULT 1) RETURNS INT
     BEGIN
         RETURN a * b;
     END;
     ```
   - In this example, if the second parameter `b` is not provided during the function call, its default value is assumed to be `1`.

### 2. Table-Valued Functions (TVFs):
   - Table-valued functions can also have default parameter values specified within the parameter list.
   - The default values work in the same way as in scalar functions.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDepartment(department_id INT DEFAULT 1) RETURNS TABLE
     BEGIN
         RETURN (SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = department_id);
     END;
     ```
   - In this example, if the `department_id` parameter is not provided during the function call, its default value is assumed to be `1`.

### 3. Aggregate Functions:
   - Aggregate functions do not typically have parameters with default values, as they operate on a set of input values derived from the SELECT statement.
   - The behavior of aggregate functions is determined solely by the input data.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
     ```
   - In this example, the `AVG` aggregate function calculates the average salary from the `salary` column of the `employees` table without any default parameters.

### 4. Window Functions:
   - Window functions also do not have parameters with default values.
   - They operate on a set of rows related to the current row (window or partition) without any customization through parameters.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, salary, 
            AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS department_average_salary
     FROM employees;
     ```
   - In this example, the `AVG` window function calculates the average salary for each department without any default parameters.

### 5. System Functions:
   - System functions also do not have parameters with default values.
   - They perform predefined operations or calculations provided by the database management system without any customization through parameters.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT CURRENT_DATE() AS current_date;
     ```
   - In this example, the `CURRENT_DATE` system function returns the current date without any default parameters.

### 6. User-Defined Functions (UDFs):
   - Default parameter values can be specified for parameters in user-defined functions similar to scalar functions.
   - The default values work in the same way as in scalar functions.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE FUNCTION AddNumbers(a INT, b INT DEFAULT 0) RETURNS INT
     BEGIN
         RETURN a + b;
     END;
     ```
   - In this example, if the second parameter `b` is not provided during the function call, its default value is assumed to be `0`.

# 5. **Variables and Scope:**
## Declaring and using variables.
In SQL, variables can be declared and used within stored procedures, functions, and scripts to store and manipulate data temporarily. Here's how you can declare and use variables in SQL:

### Declaring Variables:
Variables are declared using the `DECLARE` keyword followed by the variable name and its data type.

#### Syntax:
```sql
DECLARE variable_name data_type [DEFAULT default_value];
```

#### Example:
```sql
DECLARE @username VARCHAR(50);
DECLARE @age INT DEFAULT 30;
```

### Assigning Values to Variables:
Values can be assigned to variables using the `SET` statement.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SET variable_name = value;
```

#### Example:
```sql
SET @username = 'JohnDoe';
SET @age = 25;
```

### Using Variables in SQL Statements:
Variables can be used in SQL statements to store and manipulate data.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @username;

UPDATE users SET age = @age WHERE user_id = 1;
```


## Scope of variables in stored procedures and functions.
In SQL stored procedures and functions, variables have different scopes, which determine where they can be accessed and used within the code. Understanding the scope of variables is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable SQL code. Here's an overview of local and global variables in stored procedures and functions:

### 1. Local Variables:
   - **Definition**: Local variables are declared within the body of a stored procedure or function and have a limited scope within that block.
   - **Scope**: Local variables are only accessible within the block in which they are declared. They cannot be accessed outside of that block or in other stored procedures or functions.
   - **Lifetime**: Local variables exist only for the duration of the execution of the stored procedure or function. Once the execution completes, the values of local variables are discarded.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     CREATE PROCEDURE ExampleProcedure
     AS
     BEGIN
         DECLARE @local_variable INT;
         SET @local_variable = 10;
         -- The variable @local_variable can only be used within this procedure
         SELECT @local_variable;
     END;
     ```

### 2. Global Variables:
   - **Definition**: Global variables are declared at the database level and can be accessed from anywhere within the database.
   - **Scope**: Global variables are accessible from any stored procedure, function, or script within the database where they are defined.
   - **Lifetime**: Global variables persist throughout the lifetime of the database session. They retain their values until explicitly modified or the session ends.
   - **Example**:
     ```sql
     DECLARE @global_variable INT;
     SET @global_variable = 100;
     ```
   - Global variables are typically not recommended for general use due to potential issues with concurrency, scalability, and maintainability.

### Scope Resolution:
   - If a local variable in a stored procedure or function has the same name as a column in a table, the local variable takes precedence within the scope of the procedure or function.
   - It's important to use meaningful and distinct names for variables to avoid conflicts and confusion.

### Note:
- In SQL Server, local variables are declared using the `DECLARE` keyword, while global variables are declared using the `DECLARE @variable_name data_type` syntax outside of any stored procedure or function.
- In other database systems such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, the syntax and behavior of variables may vary. Always refer to the documentation of your specific DBMS for accurate information.

# 6. **Flow Control in Procedures and Functions:**
## IF-ELSE statements.
In SQL, the `IF-ELSE` statement allows you to conditionally execute blocks of SQL code based on a specified condition. Here's an overview of how `IF-ELSE` statements work:

### Syntax:
```sql
IF condition THEN
    -- Statements to execute if the condition is true
    statement1;
    statement2;
    ...
ELSE
    -- Statements to execute if the condition is false
    statement3;
    statement4;
    ...
END IF;
```

### Example:
```sql
DECLARE @age INT;
SET @age = 30;

IF @age >= 18 THEN
    SELECT 'Adult';
ELSE
    SELECT 'Minor';
END IF;
```

In this example:
- If the value of `@age` is greater than or equal to 18, the query will print 'Adult'.
- Otherwise, it will print 'Minor'.

### Nested IF-ELSE Statements:
You can nest `IF-ELSE` statements within each other to handle more complex conditions.

### Syntax:
```sql
IF condition1 THEN
    -- Statements to execute if condition1 is true
    IF condition2 THEN
        -- Statements to execute if condition2 is true
    ELSE
        -- Statements to execute if condition2 is false
    END IF;
ELSE
    -- Statements to execute if condition1 is false
END IF;
```

### Example:
```sql
DECLARE @score INT;
SET @score = 75;

IF @score >= 90 THEN
    SELECT 'A';
ELSEIF @score >= 80 THEN
    SELECT 'B';
ELSEIF @score >= 70 THEN
    SELECT 'C';
ELSE
    SELECT 'Fail';
END IF;
```

In this example:
- If `@score` is 90 or above, it will print 'A'.
- If `@score` is between 80 and 89, it will print 'B'.
- If `@score` is between 70 and 79, it will print 'C'.
- Otherwise, it will print 'Fail'.

### Notes:
- SQL `IF-ELSE` statements are supported in various database management systems such as SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
- The condition in an `IF` statement can be any valid SQL expression that returns a Boolean value (`TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL`).
- `ELSEIF` can be used to check multiple conditions sequentially.
- Some database systems may have slight syntax variations or additional features for `IF-ELSE` statements. Always refer to the documentation specific to your database system for precise details.

In SQL, `CASE` statements and loop constructs like `LOOP` and `WHILE` provide mechanisms for conditional execution and iterative processing. Here's an overview of each:

## CASE Statements:
The `CASE` statement evaluates a list of conditions and returns one of several possible results.

#### Syntax:
```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE default_result
END
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN grade >= 90 THEN 'A'
        WHEN grade >= 80 THEN 'B'
        WHEN grade >= 70 THEN 'C'
        ELSE 'F'
    END AS letter_grade
FROM grades;
```

## LOOP Statement:
The `LOOP` statement allows you to create an unconditional loop that continues indefinitely until terminated manually using a control statement like `LEAVE`.

#### Syntax:
```sql
LOOP
    -- Statements
    IF condition THEN
        LEAVE; -- Terminate loop
    END IF;
END LOOP;
```

#### Example:
```sql
DECLARE @counter INT;
SET @counter = 1;

LOOP
    PRINT @counter;
    SET @counter = @counter + 1;
    IF @counter > 10 THEN
        LEAVE;
    END IF;
END LOOP;
```

## WHILE Statement:
The `WHILE` statement allows you to create a loop that continues as long as a specified condition is true.

#### Syntax:
```sql
WHILE condition DO
    -- Statements
END WHILE;
```

#### Example:
```sql
DECLARE @counter INT;
SET @counter = 1;

WHILE @counter <= 10 DO
    PRINT @counter;
    SET @counter = @counter + 1;
END WHILE;
```

## Iterative Constructs:
Iterative constructs like loops (`LOOP` and `WHILE`) are used to repeat a block of SQL statements based on certain conditions. They are often used when you need to process data iteratively or perform repetitive tasks until a certain condition is met. However, it's important to use them judiciously as improper use can lead to performance issues or infinite loops.

### Notes:
- `CASE` statements are commonly used for conditional branching within a single SQL statement.
- `LOOP` and `WHILE` statements are typically used within stored procedures or functions to perform iterative tasks.
- Different database management systems may have variations in the syntax or availability of these constructs. Always refer to the documentation specific to your database system for accurate information.

# 7. **Error Handling:**
## Using TRY, CATCH for error handling.
In SQL, `TRY...CATCH` blocks provide a structured way to handle errors that occur during the execution of SQL statements. Here's how you can use `TRY...CATCH` for error handling:

### Syntax:
```sql
BEGIN TRY
    -- SQL statements that may raise an error
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    -- Error handling code
END CATCH;
```

### Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT 1 / 0; -- This will raise a divide by zero error
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'An error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
```

In this example:
- The `SELECT 1 / 0;` statement will raise a divide by zero error.
- Inside the `CATCH` block, the `ERROR_MESSAGE()` function retrieves the error message associated with the exception that occurred.

### Nested Error Handling:
You can nest `TRY...CATCH` blocks to handle errors at different levels of granularity.

### Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRY
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Nested SQL statements
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        -- Inner CATCH block
    END CATCH;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    -- Outer CATCH block
END CATCH;
```

### Error Functions and Information:
Inside the `CATCH` block, you have access to several error-related functions and information to help diagnose and handle errors effectively:

- `ERROR_MESSAGE()`: Returns the complete text of the error message.
- `ERROR_NUMBER()`: Returns the error number.
- `ERROR_SEVERITY()`: Returns the severity level of the error.
- `ERROR_STATE()`: Returns the state number of the error.

### Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRY
    -- SQL statements
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error Number: ' + CAST(ERROR_NUMBER() AS NVARCHAR);
    PRINT 'Error Message: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    PRINT 'Error Severity: ' + CAST(ERROR_SEVERITY() AS NVARCHAR);
    PRINT 'Error State: ' + CAST(ERROR_STATE() AS NVARCHAR);
END CATCH;
```

### Transaction Handling:
`TRY...CATCH` blocks can also be used to handle errors within transactions, allowing you to roll back the transaction if an error occurs.

### Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRY
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    
    -- SQL statements
    
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
        ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
    
    PRINT 'Transaction rolled back: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
```

### Notes:
- `TRY...CATCH` blocks are commonly used within stored procedures, functions, and batch scripts to handle errors gracefully.
- They provide a way to centralize error handling logic and improve the robustness of SQL code.
- Different database management systems may have variations in the syntax or availability of `TRY...CATCH` blocks. Always refer to the documentation specific to your database system for accurate information.

## SIGNAL and RESIGNAL statements.
In SQL, the `SIGNAL` and `RESIGNAL` statements are used for custom error handling and raising exceptions within stored procedures, functions, and triggers. These statements allow you to generate specific error conditions and provide additional information about the error.

### 1. SIGNAL Statement:
The `SIGNAL` statement raises an error condition with a specified SQLSTATE value and message text. It is typically used to indicate exceptional conditions or error scenarios within SQL routines.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SIGNAL SQLSTATE 'sqlstate_value' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'message';
```

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE example_procedure()
BEGIN
    -- Check condition
    IF condition THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Custom error message';
    END IF;
    -- Other statements
END;
```

In this example, if the specified condition is met, the `SIGNAL` statement raises a custom error with SQLSTATE value `'45000'` and message text `'Custom error message'`.

### 2. RESIGNAL Statement:
The `RESIGNAL` statement re-raises the last exception that occurred within a `BEGIN...END` block. It allows you to propagate the original exception with additional context or modifications.

#### Syntax:
```sql
RESIGNAL;
```

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE example_procedure()
BEGIN
    -- Attempt some operation
    BEGIN
        -- Some operation that may raise an exception
    END;
    -- Handle the exception
    BEGIN
        -- Error handling logic
    END;
    -- If necessary, re-raise the original exception with additional context
    IF condition THEN
        RESIGNAL;
    END IF;
END;
```

In this example, the `RESIGNAL` statement is used within an exception handler to propagate the original exception if a certain condition is met.

### Notes:
- `SIGNAL` and `RESIGNAL` statements are supported in various database management systems such as MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.
- These statements are particularly useful for defining custom error conditions and improving the clarity of error messages within SQL routines.
- When using `SIGNAL`, you can specify a custom SQLSTATE value and message text to provide detailed information about the error condition.
- `RESIGNAL` is often used within exception handlers to re-raise the original exception after performing additional error handling or logging operations.
- It's important to handle exceptions appropriately within your SQL routines to ensure robust error management and improve the reliability of your database applications.

## Handling exceptions in stored procedures and functions.
Handling exceptions in stored procedures and functions is crucial for robust error management in SQL. SQL provides various mechanisms for handling exceptions and errors that may occur during the execution of routines. Here's an overview of how you can handle exceptions in stored procedures and functions:

### 1. Using TRY...CATCH Blocks:
`TRY...CATCH` blocks provide a structured way to handle exceptions in SQL routines. Within these blocks, you can enclose SQL statements that might raise exceptions, and then handle those exceptions in the `CATCH` block.

#### Syntax:
```sql
BEGIN TRY
    -- SQL statements that may raise an exception
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    -- Exception handling code
END CATCH;
```

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE example_procedure()
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        -- SQL statements that may raise an exception
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        -- Exception handling code
        PRINT 'An error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    END CATCH;
END;
```

### 2. Raising Custom Errors:
You can use `RAISEERROR` or `SIGNAL` statements to raise custom errors within your stored procedures or functions. This allows you to define and handle specific error conditions.

#### Syntax (RAISEERROR):
```sql
RAISEERROR('Error message', severity_level, state);
```

#### Syntax (SIGNAL):
```sql
SIGNAL SQLSTATE 'sqlstate_value' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'message';
```

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE example_procedure()
AS
BEGIN
    IF some_condition THEN
        RAISEERROR('Custom error message', 16, 1);
    END IF;
END;
```

### 3. Returning Error Codes:
Stored procedures and functions can return error codes or status values to indicate success or failure. You can define specific error codes for different types of errors and return them to the calling code for further processing.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE example_procedure()
AS
BEGIN
    IF some_condition THEN
        RETURN 1; -- Error code indicating failure
    ELSE
        RETURN 0; -- Success
    END IF;
END;
```

### 4. Handling Rollbacks:
In case of exceptions, it's often necessary to roll back any changes made within the transaction to maintain data integrity. You can use transaction handling constructs within `TRY...CATCH` blocks to manage transaction boundaries and perform rollbacks when necessary.

#### Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRY
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- SQL statements
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
        ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
    PRINT 'Transaction rolled back: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
```

### Notes:
- Proper error handling is essential for maintaining data integrity and application reliability in SQL.
- Use `TRY...CATCH` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users or applications.
- Consider raising custom errors for specific error conditions to improve the clarity of error handling logic.
- Rollback transactions in case of exceptions to ensure that incomplete or erroneous changes are not persisted to the database.

# 8. **Dynamic SQL in Procedures:**
Constructing dynamic SQL statements involves building SQL queries dynamically at runtime based on various conditions or user inputs. While dynamic SQL provides flexibility, it also introduces potential security risks such as SQL injection. Here's an overview of how to construct dynamic SQL statements using `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` statements and how to prevent SQL injection:

## Using PREPARE and EXECUTE Statements:
The `PREPARE` statement is used to construct a dynamic SQL statement, and the `EXECUTE` statement is used to execute the prepared statement.

#### Syntax:
```sql
PREPARE statement_name FROM sql_query;
EXECUTE statement_name;
```

#### Example:
```sql
SET @sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column = ?';
PREPARE dynamic_statement FROM @sql_query;
EXECUTE dynamic_statement USING @variable_value;
```

In this example, `@sql_query` contains the dynamic SQL statement, and `@variable_value` is a placeholder value used in the query. The `USING` clause is used to pass parameters securely to the dynamic SQL statement.

## Preventing SQL Injection:
SQL injection is a common security vulnerability that occurs when untrusted user input is included in dynamic SQL statements, allowing attackers to manipulate the query's logic. To prevent SQL injection, follow these best practices:

#### a. Use Parameterized Queries:
Instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL queries, use parameterized queries with placeholders for dynamic values. This ensures that user input is treated as data rather than executable SQL code.

#### Example:
```sql
SET @sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column = ?';
PREPARE dynamic_statement FROM @sql_query;
EXECUTE dynamic_statement USING @variable_value;
```

#### b. Validate and Sanitize Input:
Validate and sanitize user input before using it in dynamic SQL statements. Ensure that input values conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters.

#### c. Limit Privileges:
Limit the privileges of database users to reduce the potential impact of successful SQL injection attacks. Use the principle of least privilege to restrict access to sensitive data and operations.

#### d. Use Stored Procedures:
Whenever possible, encapsulate dynamic SQL logic within stored procedures. Stored procedures provide a layer of abstraction and can help mitigate the risk of SQL injection by separating business logic from data access.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dynamic_query_procedure (@param INT)
AS
BEGIN
    SET @sql_query = CONCAT('SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column = ', @param);
    PREPARE dynamic_statement FROM @sql_query;
    EXECUTE dynamic_statement;
END;
```

### Notes:
- Dynamic SQL offers flexibility but requires careful handling to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.
- Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in dynamic SQL statements.
- Parameterized queries and stored procedures are effective techniques for preventing SQL injection and maintaining database security.

# 9. **Cursor Usage:**
Cursors in SQL are used to iterate through a result set row by row, enabling procedural logic to be applied to each row. Cursors are particularly useful when dealing with result sets that contain multiple rows. Here's an overview of declaring and using cursors, along with the FETCH, CLOSE, and OPEN statements, and the types of cursors available:

## Declaring Cursors:
To declare a cursor, you define it within the body of a stored procedure or a block of SQL code. Cursors can be explicitly declared, specifying the SQL query to retrieve the result set, or implicitly declared by using a SELECT statement.

#### Explicit Cursor Syntax:
```sql
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR select_statement;
```

#### Implicit Cursor Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

## Opening Cursors:
Once declared, a cursor needs to be opened to fetch rows from the result set. Opening a cursor initializes it and allows subsequent FETCH operations to retrieve rows.

#### OPEN Statement:
```sql
OPEN cursor_name;
```

## Fetching Rows:
After opening a cursor, you can use FETCH statements to retrieve rows from the result set one at a time. FETCH moves the cursor to the next row in the result set and returns the data from that row.

#### FETCH Statement:
```sql
FETCH cursor_name INTO variable1, variable2, ...;
```

## Closing Cursors:
After fetching all the rows or when you no longer need the cursor, it should be closed to release resources associated with it.

#### CLOSE Statement:
```sql
CLOSE cursor_name;
```

## Types of Cursors:
Cursors can be classified into two main types: explicit and implicit.

### a. Explicit Cursors:
Explicit cursors are declared explicitly by the programmer and offer more control over the cursor's behavior. They are typically used in stored procedures or blocks of code where precise control over the cursor operations is required.

#### Example:
```sql
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;
```

### b. Implicit Cursors:
Implicit cursors are created automatically by the database management system to handle result sets returned by SELECT statements that are not associated with an explicitly declared cursor. They are simpler to use but offer less flexibility compared to explicit cursors.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;
```

### Notes:
- Cursors in SQL enable row-level processing of result sets retrieved from queries.
- Explicit cursors provide more control and flexibility but require additional syntax to declare, open, fetch, and close.
- Implicit cursors are automatically created by the database system to handle result sets returned by SELECT statements.
- When using cursors, be mindful of performance implications, as they may introduce additional overhead, especially when processing large result sets. Consider alternatives such as set-based operations whenever possible.

# 10. **Stored Routines Security:**
Securing stored procedures and functions is essential to protect sensitive data and ensure that only authorized users can execute these routines. Here are some best practices for managing privileges and securing stored routines against unauthorized access:

## 1. Granting Privileges:
Grant appropriate privileges to users or roles to access and execute stored procedures and functions. Use the `GRANT` statement to specify the necessary permissions.

#### Syntax:
```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE procedure_name TO user_or_role;
```

#### Example:
```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE my_procedure TO user1;
```

## 2. Limiting Access:
Restrict access to stored routines by controlling who has the EXECUTE privilege. Only grant EXECUTE privileges to trusted users or roles that require access to the routines.

## 3. Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Use role-based access control to manage privileges more effectively. Create roles that encapsulate common sets of permissions and assign users to these roles.

#### Syntax (Creating Role):
```sql
CREATE ROLE role_name;
```

#### Syntax (Granting Privileges to Role):
```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE procedure_name TO role_name;
```

#### Syntax (Assigning User to Role):
```sql
GRANT role_name TO user1;
```

## 4. Revoking Privileges:
Regularly review and audit privileges to ensure that only authorized users have access to stored routines. Use the `REVOKE` statement to revoke privileges from users or roles when necessary.

#### Syntax:
```sql
REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE procedure_name FROM user_or_role;
```

#### Example:
```sql
REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE my_procedure FROM user1;
```

## 5. Encrypting Code:
Consider encrypting the source code of stored procedures and functions to prevent unauthorized access to the underlying logic. Many database management systems offer encryption features for stored routines.

## 6. Implementing Access Controls:
Leverage database features such as access controls, firewalls, and network security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the database server and stored routines.

## 7. Regular Monitoring and Auditing:
Regularly monitor and audit access to stored procedures and functions to detect any unauthorized activity. Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track who is accessing the routines and when.

## 8. Limiting Privileges within Stored Routines:
Within stored procedures and functions, limit access to sensitive data by using appropriate SQL privileges and access controls. Avoid embedding sensitive data directly within stored routines whenever possible.

### Notes:
- Securing stored procedures and functions is critical for protecting sensitive data and maintaining data integrity.
- Follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum privileges necessary for users to perform their tasks.
- Regularly review and update access controls and privileges to adapt to changing security requirements and user roles.


# 11. **Working with Transactions:**
In SQL, transactions are used to ensure data integrity by grouping multiple database operations into a single unit of work that either succeeds entirely or fails entirely. Here's how you can start and commit transactions in stored procedures, roll back transactions on errors, and use SAVEPOINT for nested transactions:

## Starting and Committing Transactions:
You can start a transaction using the `BEGIN TRANSACTION` statement and commit it using the `COMMIT` statement. All operations between the `BEGIN TRANSACTION` and `COMMIT` statements are treated as part of the same transaction.

#### Syntax (Starting a Transaction):
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
```

#### Syntax (Committing a Transaction):
```sql
COMMIT;
```

## Rolling Back Transactions on Errors:
If an error occurs within a transaction, you can roll back the transaction to undo any changes made since the transaction began. This ensures that the database remains in a consistent state.

#### Syntax (Rolling Back a Transaction):
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

## Handling Errors in Stored Procedures:
To handle errors within stored procedures, you can use `TRY...CATCH` blocks to encapsulate the transaction and handle any exceptions that occur.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE example_procedure
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        BEGIN TRANSACTION;
        -- SQL statements
        COMMIT;
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0
            ROLLBACK;
        -- Error handling code
    END CATCH;
END;
```

## Using SAVEPOINT for Nested Transactions:
SAVEPOINT allows you to define a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back if necessary. This is particularly useful for implementing nested transactions within a single transaction.

#### Syntax (Defining a SAVEPOINT):
```sql
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

#### Syntax (Rolling Back to a SAVEPOINT):
```sql
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

#### Syntax (Releasing a SAVEPOINT):
```sql
RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

#### Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- SQL statements
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
-- More SQL statements
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
-- Additional SQL statements
COMMIT;
```

### Notes:
- Transactions are crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency in database operations.
- Use transactions to group related database operations and ensure that they are executed atomically.
- Roll back transactions on errors to prevent partial changes to the database that could leave it in an inconsistent state.
- SAVEPOINTs allow for more granular control over transaction management, especially in scenarios where nested transactions are needed.

# 12. **Nested Stored Procedures and Functions:**
## Calling one stored procedure or function from another.
In SQL, you can call one stored procedure or function from another stored procedure or function. This allows you to modularize your code and reuse logic across multiple routines. Here's how you can call stored procedures or functions from within other routines:

## Calling a Stored Procedure from Another Stored Procedure:
To call a stored procedure from another stored procedure, you simply use the `EXECUTE` or `CALL` statement followed by the name of the stored procedure and any parameters it requires.

#### Syntax (EXECUTE Statement):
```sql
EXECUTE procedure_name (parameters);
```

#### Syntax (CALL Statement):
```sql
CALL procedure_name (parameters);
```

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure1
AS
BEGIN
    -- Some logic
END;

CREATE PROCEDURE procedure2
AS
BEGIN
    EXECUTE procedure1; -- Calling procedure1 from procedure2
END;
```

## Calling a Function from a Stored Procedure:
To call a function from a stored procedure, you can simply use the function name within the stored procedure's code, similar to calling any other function.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION my_function ()
RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    -- Some logic
    RETURN 1;
END;

CREATE PROCEDURE my_procedure
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE result INT;
    SET result = my_function(); -- Calling my_function from my_procedure
END;
```

### Notes:
- When calling a stored procedure or function from another routine, ensure that the necessary privileges are granted to the calling routine to execute the called routine.
- Pay attention to the parameters required by the called routine and pass them accordingly when calling the routine.
- Using modularization techniques like calling stored procedures or functions from other routines promotes code reuse, improves maintainability, and enhances readability of your SQL code.

## Nesting procedures and functions.
Nesting procedures and functions refers to the practice of defining one stored procedure or function within the body of another stored procedure or function. This allows for hierarchical organization of logic and can improve code readability and modularity. Here's how you can nest procedures and functions in SQL:

### Nesting Procedures:
You can nest stored procedures by defining one procedure within the body of another procedure. This allows you to encapsulate related logic within a single routine.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE outer_procedure
AS
BEGIN
    -- Some logic
    
    CREATE PROCEDURE inner_procedure
    AS
    BEGIN
        -- Nested procedure logic
    END;

    -- More logic
END;
```

### Nesting Functions:
Similarly, you can nest functions by defining one function within the body of another function. This allows you to create helper functions or utility functions that are used exclusively within the scope of the outer function.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION outer_function ()
RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    -- Some logic
    
    CREATE FUNCTION inner_function ()
    RETURNS INT
    BEGIN
        -- Nested function logic
        RETURN 1;
    END;

    -- More logic
    
    RETURN inner_function(); -- Calling the nested function
END;
```

### Notes:
- Nesting procedures and functions can improve code organization and maintainability by grouping related logic together.
- Nested procedures and functions are scoped within their parent routines and cannot be called from outside their parent routine.
- Be cautious when nesting routines to avoid excessive complexity and to ensure that each routine remains focused on a specific task or functionality.

# 13. **Introduction to User-Defined Functions (UDFs):**
## Overview of UDFs (User-Defined Functions):

User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in MySQL allow developers to extend the functionality of the database by defining their own custom functions. These functions can perform various tasks, such as data manipulation, calculations, string operations, and more. UDFs provide flexibility and enable developers to encapsulate complex logic into reusable components.

## Creating UDFs in MySQL:

To create a UDF in MySQL, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Write the Function Logic:** Define the logic for your custom function using SQL or other supported programming languages such as C/C++.

2. **Compile the Function:** Compile the function code into a shared library (DLL on Windows, SO file on Unix-like systems) using a compiler compatible with MySQL's UDF requirements.

3. **Install the Function:** Load the compiled shared library into the MySQL server using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement or by placing the library in the appropriate directory where MySQL looks for UDF libraries.

### Example: Creating a Simple UDF in MySQL:

Let's say we want to create a UDF that calculates the square of a number. Here's how you might do it:

1. Write the C code for the UDF (e.g., `udf_square.c`):
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <mysql.h>

   my_bool square_init(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args, char *message) {
       return 0;
   }

   double square(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args, char *is_null, char *error) {
       double num = *((double*)args->args[0]);
       return num * num;
   }
   ```

2. Compile the code into a shared library:
   ```
   gcc -shared -o udf_square.so udf_square.c `mysql_config --cflags --libs`
   ```

3. Load the UDF into MySQL:
   ```sql
   CREATE FUNCTION square RETURNS REAL SONAME 'udf_square.so';
   ```

## Using UDFs in MySQL:

Once a UDF is installed, you can use it in SQL statements just like built-in functions. Here's an example of using the `square` UDF we created:

```sql
SELECT square(5); -- Returns 25
```

### Notes:
