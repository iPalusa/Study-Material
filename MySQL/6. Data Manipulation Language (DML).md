# 1. **Introduction to Data Manipulation Language (DML):**

## Understanding the role of DML in database operations:

**DML (Data Manipulation Language)** is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) responsible for managing and manipulating data stored in a database. The primary role of DML is to interact with the data within database tables. It includes operations such as inserting new data, updating existing data, and deleting data from tables. The key aspects of DML include:

### 1. **Data Modification:**
   - DML allows users and applications to modify the contents of the database. This modification can involve adding new records, changing existing values, or removing records.

### 2. **User Interaction:**
   - DML statements are used by users and applications to interact with the database dynamically. Users can insert, update, or delete data based on their requirements.

### 3. **Ensuring Data Integrity:**
   - DML operations play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the data. They ensure that the data stored in the database remains accurate, consistent, and valid over time.

### 4. **Supporting Transactions:**
   - DML is an integral part of database transactions. Transactions are sequences of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit. DML statements within transactions provide a way to ensure that the database remains in a consistent state.

### 5. **Enforcing Constraints:**
   - DML operations must adhere to the constraints defined on the database tables. Constraints include rules such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints that help maintain data accuracy and relationships.


# 2. **INSERT Statement:**

### Basic `INSERT`:

```sql
-- Insert a single row with specific values
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date)
VALUES (101, 'John', 'Doe', '2024-02-04');
```
- **Purpose:** Inserts a single row with specific values into the `employees` table.
- **Use Case:** Adding a new employee with known information.
### Inserting from Another Table:

```sql
-- Insert data from one table into another
INSERT INTO new_employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM temporary_employees;
```
- **Purpose:** Copies data from `temporary_employees` to `new_employees`.
- **Use Case:** Migrating or consolidating data from a temporary table.
### Inserting with Default Values:

```sql
-- Insert a row with default values for some columns
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (102, 'Jane', 'Smith', DEFAULT);
```
- **Purpose:** Inserts a row with specified values and default for one column.
- **Use Case:** Adding an employee with some information, leaving other fields to default.
### Inserting with Subqueries:

```sql
-- Insert using a subquery for data retrieval
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary)
VALUES (103, 'Bob', 'Johnson', (SELECT salary FROM salary_history WHERE employee_id = 103));
```
- **Purpose:** Uses a subquery to retrieve salary from another table.
- **Use Case:** Populating the `employees` table with salary information from a history table.
### Inserting Multiple Rows:

```sql
-- Insert multiple rows with a single statement
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES 
  (104, 'Alice', 'Williams'),
  (105, 'Charlie', 'Brown');
```
- **Purpose:** Inserts multiple rows at once.
- **Use Case:** Bulk insertion of new employees into the `employees` table.
### Inserting with Explicit Columns:

```sql
-- Insert data into specific columns, leaving others with default or NULL values
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (106, 'David', 'Lee');
```
- **Purpose:** Inserts data into specific columns, leaving others with default or NULL values.
- **Use Case:** Adding an employee with certain details, allowing others to be set to defaults.
### Inserting with Explicit Columns and Default Values:

```sql
-- Insert data into specific columns, using default for others
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date)
VALUES (107, 'Eva', 'Miller', DEFAULT);
```
- **Purpose:** Inserts data into specific columns, using the default for another column.
- **Use Case:** Adding an employee with certain details, allowing the `hire_date` to take the default value.
### Inserting with Subquery for Multiple Rows:

```sql
-- Insert multiple rows using a subquery for data retrieval
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name)
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM temp_employees WHERE hire_date > '2023-01-01';
```
- **Purpose:** Uses a subquery to filter and retrieve data for insertion.
- **Use Case:** Adding employees from a temporary table to the main `employees` table based on a condition.


# 3. **UPDATE Statement:**

### 1. **Basic UPDATE:**
   - Update the salary of an employee with `employee_id = 101` to 70000.
   ```sql
   UPDATE employees
   SET salary = 70000
   WHERE employee_id = 101;
   ```

### 2. **Updating Multiple Columns:**
   - Update both the `first_name` and `last_name` columns for an employee with `employee_id = 102`.
   ```sql
   UPDATE employees
   SET first_name = 'Mary', last_name = 'Johnson'
   WHERE employee_id = 102;
   ```

### 3. **Using Subqueries in SET Clause:**
   - Increase the salary of all employees by 5% who have a salary lower than the average salary.
   ```sql
   UPDATE employees
   SET salary = salary * 1.05
   WHERE salary < (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
   ```

### 4. **Updating Based on Subquery Conditions:**
   - Update the status of employees to 'Senior' if their experience is greater than 5 years.
   ```sql
   UPDATE employees
   SET status = 'Senior'
   WHERE DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), hire_date) > 1825;
   ```

### 5. **Conditional Update with CASE Statement:**
   - Update the `status` column based on the department of an employee.
   ```sql
   UPDATE employees
   SET status = 
       CASE
           WHEN department = 'IT' THEN 'Tech'
           WHEN department = 'HR' THEN 'Human Resources'
           ELSE 'Other'
       END;
   ```

### 6. **Updating with LIMIT (MySQL-specific):**
   - Update the salary of the top 5 highest-paid employees.
   ```sql
   UPDATE employees
   SET salary = salary * 1.1
   ORDER BY salary DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

### 7. **Updating with JOIN (MySQL syntax):**
   - Update the salary of employees in the 'IT' department using a JOIN.
   ```sql
   UPDATE employees e
   JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
   SET e.salary = e.salary * 1.08
   WHERE d.department_name = 'IT';
   ```

# 4. **DELETE Statement:**
Certainly! Below is a cheat sheet with examples for different types of `DELETE` statements in MySQL:

### 1. **Basic DELETE:**
   - Delete all records from the table.

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM table_name;
   ```

### 2. **DELETE with WHERE Clause:**
   - Delete specific records based on a condition.

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees WHERE salary < 50000;
   ```

### 3. **DELETE with LIMIT:**
   - Delete a specified number of records.

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM products ORDER BY creation_date LIMIT 10;
   ```

### 4. **DELETE Using Subquery:**
   - Delete records based on a subquery condition.

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM orders WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE last_purchase_date < '2022-01-01');
   ```

### 5. **DELETE Using Joins:**
   - Delete records from multiple tables using a JOIN condition.

   ```sql
   DELETE employees, departments FROM employees
   JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id
   WHERE departments.location = 'Headquarters';
   ```

### 6. **DELETE with RETURNING (Non-Standard):**
   - Retrieve and delete specific columns from deleted rows (non-standard MySQL extension).

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 5 RETURNING employee_id, last_name INTO @deleted_employee_id, @deleted_last_name;
   ```

### 7. **DELETE Using Aliases:**
   - Use aliases to simplify and shorten the DELETE statement.

   ```sql
   DELETE e FROM employees e WHERE e.salary < 30000;
   ```

### 8. **DELETE with Cascading:**
   - Utilize cascading deletes to remove related records from other tables.

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1001; -- Cascading deletes remove related orders, payments, etc.
   ```

4.  **Transactions and ACID Properties:**
    - Understanding transactions in the context of DML operations.
    - Overview of ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

5.  **Error Handling and Rollback:**
    - Handling errors in DML operations.
    - Using the ROLLBACK statement to revert changes in case of errors.

6.  **Triggers and DML Operations:**
    - Introduction to triggers and their role in response to DML events.
    - Creating triggers for specific DML operations.
