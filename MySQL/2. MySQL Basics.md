# Creating Databases:

1. **Create a Database:**
   - To create a new database, you can use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement.
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE database_name;
   ```

2. **Select the Database:**
   - After creating a database, you need to switch to it to perform operations within that database.
   ```sql
   USE database_name;
   ```

# Deleting Databases:
To delete a database and a table in MySQL, you can use the `DROP` statement. However, exercise caution when using `DROP` as it permanently deletes the specified database or table along with all its data. Make sure to backup your data before performing such operations.

## Deleting a Table:

To delete a table, you can use the `DROP TABLE` statement:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to delete.

## Deleting a Database:

To delete a database, you can use the `DROP DATABASE` statement:

```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

Replace `database_name` with the name of the database you want to delete.

## Examples:

Deleting a table:
```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```

Deleting a database:
```sql
DROP DATABASE mydatabase;
```

# Creating Tables:

1. **Syntax for Creating a Table:**
   - You use the `CREATE TABLE` statement to define a new table along with its columns and their data types.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE table_name (
       column1_name data_type,
       column2_name data_type,
       ...
   );
   ```

2. **Example of Creating a Table:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
       employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       first_name VARCHAR(50),
       last_name VARCHAR(50),
       hire_date DATE
   );
   ```
# Truncation
The `TRUNCATE` statement in MySQL is used to delete all the rows from a table, but it retains the table structure for future use. It's a more efficient way to remove all data from a table compared to the `DELETE` statement, especially when you want to quickly clear the contents of a table without affecting its structure.

## Syntax:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to truncate.

## Example:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
```

In this example, all rows in the "employees" table will be removed, but the table structure will remain intact.

## Differences between TRUNCATE and DELETE:

1. **Performance:**
   - `TRUNCATE` is generally faster than `DELETE` because it doesn't generate individual row delete statements.

2. **Rollback:**
   - `TRUNCATE` is not transaction-safe and cannot be rolled back. Once you execute a `TRUNCATE` statement, the data is immediately removed.

3. **Resetting Auto-Increment:**
   - `TRUNCATE` resets auto-increment columns to their seed value, whereas `DELETE` does not.

4. **Permissions:**
   - `TRUNCATE` requires the `DROP` privilege on the table, but `DELETE` requires the `DELETE` privilege.

# Data Types in MySQL:

1. **Numeric Data Types:**
   - `INT`, `BIGINT`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`: Used for storing numeric values.

2. **String Data Types:**
   - `VARCHAR(size)`, `CHAR(size)`: Used for storing variable-length and fixed-length strings, respectively.

3. **Date and Time Data Types:**
   - `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`: Used for storing date and time information.

4. **Boolean Data Type:**
   - `BOOLEAN`: Represents true or false values.

5. **Other Data Types:**
   - `BLOB`: Binary Large Object for storing binary data.
   - `TEXT`: Used for large text data.
   - `ENUM`: Represents a set of predefined values.

## Example of a Table with Data Types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    in_stock BOOLEAN,
    release_date DATE
);
```

This example creates a table named "products" with columns for product ID, name, price, availability status, and release date.
