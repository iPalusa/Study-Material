}
```

1. **`$addToSet`:**
   Adds elements to an array only if they are not already present.
   ```json
   { $addToSet: { scores: 95 } }
   ```

2. **`$concatArrays`:**
   Concatenates arrays together.
   ```json
   { $concatArrays: ["$grades", [87, 88]] }
   ```

3. **`$filter`:**
   Filters elements from an array based on a condition.
   - input: "$scores" specifies that we want to filter the "scores" array.
   - as: "score" sets up a variable score to represent each element during filtering.
   - cond: { $gte: ["$$score", 90] } defines the condition to include only elements where the score is greater than or equal to 90.
   ```json
   {
     $filter: {
       input: "$assignments",
       as: "assignment",
       cond: { $gte: ["$$assignment.scores", 90] }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **`$first`:**
   Returns the first element of an array.
   ```json
   { $first: "$grades" }
   ```

5. **`$last`:**
   Returns the last element of an array.
   ```json
   { $last: "$grades" }
   ```

6. **`$indexOfArray`:**
   Returns the index of the first occurrence of an element in an array.
   ```json
   { $indexOfArray: ["$grades", 88] }
   ```

7. **`$range`:**
   Creates an array of numbers.
   ```json
   { $range: [0, 5, 2] }
   ```

8. **`$reduce`:**
   Applies a function cumulatively to the elements of an array, reducing it to a single value.
   - input: "$scores" specifies the array to be reduced (assuming a field named "scores" exists in the documents).
   - initialValue: 0 sets the initial value of the accumulator to 0.
   - in: { $add: ["$$value", "$$this"] } defines the expression to be applied for each element in the array. $$value refers to the current value of the accumulator, and $$this refers to the current element being processed. The $add operator is used to add the current element to the accumulator.
   ```json
   {
     $reduce: {
       input: "$scores",
       initialValue: 0,       
       in: { $add: ["$$value", "$$this"] }
     }
   }
   ```

9. **`$size`:**
   Returns the number of elements in an array.
   ```json
   { $size: "$grades" }
   ```

10. **`$slice`:**
    Returns a subset of an array.
    ```json
    { $slice: ["$grades", 1, 2] }
    ```

11. **`$sort`:**
    Sorts the elements of an array.
    ```json
    { $sort: { scores: 1 } }
    ```

12. **`$zip`:**
    Combines multiple arrays into a single array of documents.
    ```json
    {
      $zip: {
        inputs: ["$students", "$courses"]
      }
    }
    ```
  
Certainly! Below are 25 complex challenge exercises for the given data using various methods, including `$filter`, `$addToSet`, `$concatArrays`, `$reduce`, `$sort`, `$slice`, `$zip`, and more.

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
])
```
```json
"assignments": [
  { "scores": [90, 85, 92] },
  { "scores": [88, 91, 89] }
]
```
Initial Accumulator Value ($$value): 0
First Iteration ({ "scores": [90, 85, 92] }):
- $sum: "$$this.scores" calculates the sum: 90 + 85 + 92 = 267
- { $add: ["$$value", 267] } adds the sum to the accumulator: 0 + 267 = 267
Second Iteration ({ "scores": [88, 91, 89] }):
- $sum: "$$this.scores" calculates the sum: 88 + 91 + 89 = 268
- { $add: ["$$value", 268] } adds the sum to the accumulator: 267 + 268 = 535
