In a library management system, you might need several collections to represent different entities and relationships. Here are some suggested collections for a basic library management system in MongoDB:

1. **Books:**
   - Information about each book in the library.
   - Fields: `_id`, `title`, `author`, `genre`, `publishedDate`, `ISBN`, `copiesAvailable`, etc.

2. **Members:**
   - Information about library members or users.
   - Fields: `_id`, `name`, `email`, `membershipDate`, `borrowedBooks` (an array of book IDs), etc.

3. **Authors:**
   - Information about authors.
   - Fields: `_id`, `name`, `biography`, `books` (an array of book IDs written by the author), etc.

4. **Genres:**
   - Different genres or categories of books.
   - Fields: `_id`, `name`, `description`, etc.

5. **Transactions:**
   - Records of book transactions, including borrow and return actions.
   - Fields: `_id`, `bookId`, `memberId`, `transactionType` (borrow or return), `transactionDate`, etc.

6. **BookReviews:**
   - Reviews or ratings provided by members for books.
   - Fields: `_id`, `bookId`, `memberId`, `rating`, `reviewText`, `reviewDate`, etc.

7. **Publishers:**
   - Information about book publishers.
   - Fields: `_id`, `name`, `address`, `contactInfo`, `publishedBooks` (an array of book IDs published by the publisher), etc.

8. **BookCopies:**
   - Records of individual physical copies of books.
   - Fields: `_id`, `bookId`, `copyNumber`, `status` (available, borrowed, lost, etc.), `acquisitionDate`, etc.


Sure, here are 75 complex challenge exercises for a library management system using MongoDB:

# Books Collection:

### 1. Retrieve the details of all books published before a specific date.
```json
db.Books.find({ publishedDate: { $lt: ISODate("2023-01-01") } })
```
### 2. Find the book with the highest number of copies available.
```json
db.Books.aggregate([
  { $sort: { copiesAvailable: -1 } },
  { $limit: 5 },
  { $project: { ISBN: 0, publishedDate: 0 } }
])
```
### 3. Update the genre of a specific book.
```shell
db.Books.updateOne(
  { ISBN: "your_book_isbn" },  // Specify the book using its ISBN
  { $set: { genre: "new_genre" } }  // Set the new genre value
);

```
### 4. Delete all books with no available copies.
```shell
db.Books.deleteMany({ copiesAvailable: 0 });
```
### 5. Find books with titles containing a specific word.
```shell
db.Books.find({ "title": { $regex: /text/i } }) //i = case-insensitive 
```
### 6. Count the number of books in each genre.
```shell
db.Books.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$genre",
            bookCount: { $sum: 1 }
        }
    }
])
```
### 7. Retrieve the latest published book for a given author.
```shell
db.Books.find({ author: "J.R.R. Tolkien" }).sort({ publishedDate: -1 }).limit(1);
```
### 8. Increment the available copies of a book by a certain number.
```shell
db.Books.updateOne(
  { ISBN: "your_book_isbn" },  // Specify the book using its ISBN
  { $inc: { copiesAvailable: 5 } }  // Increment the available copies by 5 (or any other number)
);
```
### 9. Find books borrowed by a specific member.
```shell
db.Transactions.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      memberId: 101,
      transactionType: "borrow"
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "Books",
      localField: "bookId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "borrowedBooks"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$borrowedBooks"
  },
  {
    $project: {
      bookId: "$borrowedBooks._id",
      bookName: "$borrowedBooks.title"
    }
  }
]);
```
### 10. Retrieve the books borrowed within a specific date range.
```shell
db.Transactions.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      transactionType: "borrow",
      transactionDate: {
        $gte: ISODate("2021-09-01T00:00:00Z"),
        $lte: ISODate("2022-05-01T23:59:59Z")
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "Books",
      localField: "bookId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "borrowedBook"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$borrowedBook"
  },
  {
    $project: {
      bookId: "$borrowedBook._id",
      title: "$borrowedBook.title",
      author: "$borrowedBook.author",
      genre: "$borrowedBook.genre",
      transactionDate: 1
    }
  }
]);
```

# Members Collection:

### 11. Identify members who joined the library before a certain year.
```shell
db.members.find({ "membershipDate": { "$lt": new Date("2020-01-01") } })
```
### 12. Update the email address of a specific member.
```shell
db.members.updateOne({ "_id": ObjectId("60a12345678901234567890") }, { "$set": { "email": "newemail@example.com" } })
```
### 13. Find members who borrowed more than a certain number of books.
```shell
db.Members.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "Transactions",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "memberId",
      as: "transactions",
    },
  },
  {
    $match: {
      "transactions.transactionType": "borrow",
    },
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$_id",
      memberName: { $first: "$name" },
      totalBorrowedBooks: { $sum: { $size: "$borrowedBooks" } },
    },
  },
  {
    $match: {
      totalBorrowedBooks: { $gt: 2 },
    },
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      memberName: 1,
      totalBorrowedBooks: 1,
    },
  },
]);
```
### 14. Delete members who have not borrowed any books.
```shell
db.Members.deleteMany({ borrowedBooks: { $exists: true, $eq: [] } })
```
### 15. Count the number of members who joined in each month.
```shell
db.Members.aggregate([
    {
        $group: {
            _id: { $month: "$membershipDate" },
            memberCount: { $sum: 1 }
        }
    }
])
```
### 16. Retrieve the books borrowed by members with a specific membership date.
```shell

db.Transactions.aggregate([
    {
        $match: {
            memberId: { $in: db.Members.find({ membershipDate: {new Date("2020-01-24")} }).map(m => m._id) }
        }
    },
    {
        $lookup: {
            from: "Books",
            localField: "bookId",
            foreignField: "_id",
            as: "borrowedBooks"
        }
    }
])
```
### 17. Increment the borrowedBooks array for a specific member.
```shell
db.Members.updateOne(
  { _id: "memberId" },
  { $push: { borrowedBooks: "bookId" } }
)
```

```shell
db.Members.find({
  borrowedBooks: { $exists: true, $eq: [] },
  membershipDate: { $lt: new Date(new Date().setMonth(new Date().getMonth() - 6)) }
})
```
- `new Date()` creates a new JavaScript Date object, representing the current date and time.
- `new Date().getMonth()` retrieves the month (0-indexed) from the current date.
- `new Date().setMonth(new Date().getMonth() - 6)` sets the month of the current date to be six months ago.
- `new Date(new Date().setMonth(new Date().getMonth() - 6))` creates a new Date object with the month set to six months ago.

```shell
db.Members.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "Books",

      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "borrowedBooksInfo"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$borrowedBooksInfo"
  },
  {
    $match: {
      "borrowedBooksInfo.author": "J.R.R. Tolkien"

  },
  {
    $match: {
      $or: [
        { writtenBooks: { $exists: false } }, # This condition checks if the writtenBooks array field does not exist or is null. If it doesn't exist or is null, it implies that the author has not written any books.
