# 8. Data Replication


## **1. Replica Sets:**

- A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set for redundancy and high availability.
- Replica sets provide data replication and fault tolerance. If one server fails, the others can continue to serve the application.
- Typically, a replica set consists of three or more servers: one primary node and multiple secondary nodes.

## **2. Primary and Secondary Nodes:**

- Within a MongoDB replica set, nodes have different roles:
  - **Primary Node:** The primary node is the read-write node. It's the only node that accepts write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) and serves read operations.
  - **Secondary Nodes:** Secondary nodes are read-only nodes. They replicate data from the primary node and can serve read operations. Secondary nodes are used for distributing read traffic and increasing read capacity.

## **3. Automatic Failover:**

- Automatic failover is a key feature of MongoDB replica sets. It ensures that if the primary node becomes unavailable, one of the secondary nodes is automatically elected as the new primary to maintain database availability.

Here's how these concepts work together in a MongoDB replica set with examples:

1. **Creating a Replica Set:**

   To create a replica set, you need to initiate it with a configuration object. Here's an example configuration for a replica set with three nodes:

   ```json
   {
     "_id": "myReplicaSet",
     "members": [
       { "_id": 0, "host": "server1:27017" },
       { "_id": 1, "host": "server2:27017" },
       { "_id": 2, "host": "server3:27017" }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Initializing Replica Set:**

   You can use the `rs.initiate()` method to initialize the replica set with the above configuration.

   ```javascript
   rs.initiate({
     _id: "myReplicaSet",
     members: [
       { _id: 0, host: "server1:27017" },
       { _id: 1, host: "server2:27017" },
       { _id: 2, host: "server3:27017" }
     ]
   })
   ```

3. **Example of Automatic Failover:**

   Let's say "server1" is the primary node, and "server2" and "server3" are secondary nodes. If "server1" goes down due to hardware failure, automatic failover will occur. One of the remaining nodes, for example, "server2," will be elected as the new primary.

4. **Monitoring Replica Set:**

   MongoDB provides a mechanism for monitoring the replica set status and behavior. You can use commands like `rs.status()` and `rs.isMaster()` to check the current replica set status and the primary node.

   ```javascript
   rs.status()
   ```

   This command provides information about the replica set, including which node is the primary and the state of secondary nodes.

Replica sets in MongoDB ensure data redundancy and high availability. They are commonly used in production environments to provide fault tolerance and load distribution. Automatic failover simplifies the process of maintaining database availability even when the primary node experiences failures.
