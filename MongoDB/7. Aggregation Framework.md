# 7.Aggregation Framework

## **1. Pipeline Stages:**

The Aggregation Framework in MongoDB allows you to process and manipulate data in a series of stages, each of which performs a specific operation on the input data. Pipeline stages are applied in a sequence, and the result of one stage becomes the input for the next stage. Here are some common pipeline stages:


### 1. **$addFields:**

#### Explanation:
The `$addFields` stage is used to add new fields to documents in the pipeline. It allows you to create new fields based on existing fields, constants, or expressions. This stage doesn't modify the original documents in the collection but adds the specified fields to the output documents.

#### Example:
```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
   { $addFields: { newField: "example" } }
]);
```

### 2. **$bucket:**

#### Explanation:
Categorizes documents into buckets based on a specified expression.

#### Example:
```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
   {
      $bucket: {
         groupBy: "$amount",
         boundaries: [0, 100, 500, 1000],
         default: "Other",
         output: { count: { $sum: 1 } }
      }
   }
]);
```

### 3. **$bucketAuto:**

#### Explanation:
Automatically categorizes documents into buckets.

#### Example:
```javascript
db.sales.aggregate([
   {
      $bucketAuto: {
         groupBy: "$amount",
         buckets: 5,
         output: { count: { $sum: 1 } }
      }
   }
]);
```

### 4. **$collStats:**

#### Explanation:
Returns statistics regarding a collection or view.

#### Example:
```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
   { $collStats: { latencyStats: { histograms: true } } }
]);
```

### 5. **$count:**

#### Explanation:
Returns the number of documents in the pipeline.

#### Example:
```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
   { $count: "documentCount" }
]);
```

### **2. Aggregation Operators:**

Aggregation operators are used within the various stages of the aggregation pipeline to perform specific operations on the data. Some common aggregation operators include:

- **$sum:** Calculates the sum of numeric values in a group.

  ```json
  { $group: { _id: "$category", totalSales: { $sum: "$sales" } } }
  ```

- **$avg:** Calculates the average of numeric values in a group.

  ```json
  { $group: { _id: "$department", averageSalary: { $avg: "$salary" } } }
  ```

- **$max and $min:** Find the maximum and minimum values in a group, respectively.

  ```json
  { $group: { _id: "$product", maxPrice: { $max: "$price" }, minPrice: { $min: "$price" } } }
  ```

- **$addToSet:** Adds unique values to an array.

  ```json
  { $group: { _id: "$department", uniqueSkills: { $addToSet: "$skills" } } }
  ```

- **$first and $last:** Retrieve the first and last values in a group.

  ```json
  { $group: { _id: "$category", firstItem: { $first: "$item" }, lastItem: { $last: "$item" } } }
  ```

### **3. Grouping and Shaping Data:**

The `$group` stage is particularly powerful for grouping and shaping data in the Aggregation Framework. It groups documents by a specific field and applies aggregation operators to calculate or transform the grouped data. For example, you can use the `$group` stage to calculate the average salary in each department:

```json
{
  $group: {
    _id: "$department",
    averageSalary: { $avg: "$salary" }
  }
}
```

This stage groups documents by the "department" field and calculates the average salary for each department. The output will consist of documents where each document represents a department and its average salary.
