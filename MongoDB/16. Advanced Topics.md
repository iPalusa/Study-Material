Let's explore the concepts of change streams, full-text search, geospatial queries, and time-series data in MongoDB:

**1. Change Streams:**

- Change streams in MongoDB allow you to monitor changes to data in real-time. They provide a way to capture and react to data changes in a collection, such as inserts, updates, and deletes.

- Change streams can be used to build real-time applications, trigger actions, or maintain synchronized data across distributed systems.

**Example of Change Streams:**

```javascript
const pipeline = [
  { $match: { operationType: "insert" } }
];

const changeStream = db.collection("myCollection").watch(pipeline);

changeStream.on("change", (change) => {
  console.log("Change detected: ", change.fullDocument);
});
```

In this example, we create a change stream to watch for insert operations on a collection and log the newly inserted documents when changes occur.

**2. Full-Text Search:**

- Full-text search in MongoDB enables you to perform text-based searches on text fields in your documents. MongoDB provides text indexing and text search capabilities.

- You can use text search to find documents that match a given text query and rank results by relevance.

**Example of Full-Text Search:**

```javascript
db.articles.createIndex({ content: "text" });

db.articles.find({ $text: { $search: "MongoDB tutorial" } });
```

In this example, we create a text index on the "content" field of an "articles" collection and perform a text search to find articles containing the words "MongoDB" and "tutorial."

**3. Geospatial Queries:**

- MongoDB supports geospatial queries to work with geographic data. It enables you to store and query data associated with locations, such as points, polygons, and lines.

- MongoDB provides two types of geospatial indexes: 2d (flat Earth) and 2dsphere (spherical Earth). You can use geospatial queries to find locations within a specific distance or contained within a geographic area.

**Example of Geospatial Query:**

```javascript
db.places.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" });

db.places.find({
  location: {
    $near: {
      $geometry: {
        type: "Point",
        coordinates: [longitude, latitude]
      },
      $maxDistance: 1000  // Within 1 kilometer
    }
  }
});
```

In this example, we create a 2dsphere index on the "location" field of a "places" collection and query for places near a specific geographic point within a 1-kilometer radius.

**4. Time-Series Data with MongoDB:**

- MongoDB can be used to store and query time-series data, such as sensor data, logs, and time-stamped events.

- You can model time-series data by storing timestamps and relevant data in documents and use indexing and aggregation to perform time-based queries.

**Example of Time-Series Data:**

```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "timestamp": ISODate("2023-10-17T14:30:00Z"),
  "temperature": 25.5
}
```

In this example, we have a document with a timestamp and temperature reading. You can create indexes on the "timestamp" field and perform queries like retrieving data within a specific time range or aggregating data by time intervals.
