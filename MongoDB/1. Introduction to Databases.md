# 1. Introduction to Databases

## **What is data?**

Data refers to any collection of facts, statistics, or information that can be stored, processed, and used for various purposes. Data can take many forms, including text, numbers, images, audio, video, and more. In the context of databases, data is typically organized and structured in a way that makes it easier to manage, access, and analyze.

## **Data vs Information**

Data and information are related concepts, but they have distinct meanings:

**Data:**
- Data refers to raw facts, numbers, symbols, or values without any context.
- It is unprocessed and lacks meaning on its own.
- Data can come in various forms, such as text, numbers, images, audio, or video.
- Examples of data include: "12345," "John Smith," "1.5," "A," "010101."

**Information:**
- Information is data that has been processed, organized, or interpreted to give it context, meaning, and relevance.
- Information is the result of data analysis and provides knowledge or understanding.
- It helps people make decisions, answer questions, or communicate effectively.
- Examples of information include: "John Smith's phone number is 555-1234," "The temperature is 1.5 degrees Celsius," "A is the grade for the student," "010101 is a binary code for 5."


## **What is a database?**

A database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data. They provide a systematic and organized way to store information, making it easier to search, access, and manipulate data. Databases are used in various applications, such as websites, mobile apps, business systems, and more.

## **Types of databases (SQL vs. NoSQL)**

There are two main types of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases.

- **SQL Databases:**
  - SQL databases are relational databases.
  - They use a structured schema with tables, rows, and columns.
  - Data is stored in a tabular format.
  - SQL databases are suitable for applications where data relationships and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions are critical. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

- **NoSQL Databases:**
  - NoSQL databases are non-relational databases.
  - They do not require a fixed schema and can store unstructured or semi-structured data.
  - Data can be stored in various formats, including JSON, BSON, or key-value pairs.
  - NoSQL databases are suitable for applications that require scalability, flexibility, and the ability to handle large volumes of data with high throughput. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.

## **Introduction to MongoDB**

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that falls under the category of document-oriented databases. It stores data in a format known as BSON (Binary JSON), which is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. MongoDB is designed for flexibility and scalability and is commonly used in web and mobile applications, as well as for handling large volumes of data. It offers features like horizontal scaling, replication, and a rich query language for data retrieval and manipulation.

This brief introduction to MongoDB provides a glimpse of its role in managing and storing data, especially when dealing with unstructured or semi-structured information. MongoDB is known for its ease of use and is often favored for its flexibility in schema design compared to traditional SQL databases.
