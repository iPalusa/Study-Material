# 5. Functions

## **1. Defining and Calling Functions:**
   - Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
   - You define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses containing any parameters.
   - You call a function by using its name followed by parentheses.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   def greet(name):
       print(f"Hello, {name}!")

   greet("Alice")  # Calling the function
   ```

## **2. Parameters and Arguments:**
   - Parameters are placeholders for values that a function expects.
   - Arguments are the actual values passed to a function when it is called.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   def add(x, y):  # x and y are parameters
       return x + y

   result = add(3, 4)  # 3 and 4 are arguments
   ```

## **3. Return Values:**
   - Functions can return values using the `return` statement.
   - You can capture the return value of a function when you call it.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   def square(x):
       return x ** 2

   result = square(5)  # result will be 25
   ```

## **4. Scope and Lifetime of Variables:**
   - The scope of a variable defines where in the code the variable is accessible.
   - Local variables are defined within a function and have local scope.
   - Global variables are defined outside functions and have global scope.
   - The lifetime of a local variable is limited to the function's execution.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   global_var = 10

   def my_function():
       local_var = 5
       print(global_var)  # Accessing a global variable
       print(local_var)

   my_function()
   print(global_var)
   # print(local_var)  # This will result in an error because local_var is not accessible here.
   ```

## **5. Lambda Functions:**
   - Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined with the `lambda` keyword.
   - They are often used for short, simple operations.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   add = lambda x, y: x + y
   result = add(3, 4)  # result will be 7
   ```

## **6. Recursion:**
   - Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem.
   - It's commonly used for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, similar tasks.
   
   Example (calculating factorial):
   ```python
   def factorial(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 1
       else:
           return n * factorial(n - 1)

   result = factorial(5)  # result will be 120
   ```
