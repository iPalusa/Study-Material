# 2. Basic Syntax and Data Types

## **1. Variables and Data Types:**
   - Variables are used to store data in Python.
   - Common data types include:
     - `int`: Integer values (e.g., 1, -5, 100).
     - `float`: Floating-point values (e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.0).
     - `str`: Strings, which are sequences of characters (e.g., "Hello, Python!").
     - `bool`: Booleans representing True or False.

## **2. Operators:**
   - Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation).
   - Comparison Operators: `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
   - Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.

## **3. Comments and Docstrings:**
   - Comments are used to add explanations to your code and are ignored by the interpreter. They start with `#`.
     ```python
     # This is a comment
     ```
   - Docstrings are used for documenting functions, classes, and modules. They are enclosed in triple-quotes and can span multiple lines.
     ```python
     def my_function():
         """
         This is a docstring.
         It provides information about the function.
         """
         # Function code here
     ```

## **4. Type Conversion and Casting:**
   - Python allows you to convert between different data types using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`.
     ```python
     x = 5
     y = str(x)  # Convert integer to string
     z = float("3.14")  # Convert string to float
     ```

## **5. Input and Output:**
   - `input()`: Allows the user to enter data from the keyboard. It returns a string.
     ```python
     name = input("Enter your name: ")
     ```
   - `print()`: Used to display information on the screen.
     ```python
     print("Hello, " + name)
     ```

Here's a simple example that combines these concepts:

```python
# Get user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Perform a calculation
birth_year = 2023 - age

# Display the result
print("Hello, " + name)
print("You were born in", birth_year)
```
