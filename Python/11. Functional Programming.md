# 11.Functional Programming


## **1. Map, Filter, Reduce:**
   - `map`: Applies a function to each item in an iterable (e.g., a list) and returns a new iterable with the results.
   - `filter`: Filters items from an iterable based on a specified condition and returns a new iterable with the filtered items.
   - `reduce`: Applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing it to a single value.

   Example (map):
   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)
   ```

## **2. List Comprehensions:**
   - List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterables.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]
   ```

## **3. Generators and Iterators:**
   - Generators are a way to create iterators in a more efficient and memory-friendly manner. They use the `yield` keyword.
   - Iterators are objects that represent a stream of data and can be iterated one item at a time.

   Example (generator):
   ```python
   def countdown(n):
       while n > 0:
           yield n
           n -= 1

   for i in countdown(5):
       print(i)
   ```

## **4. Decorators:**
   - Decorators are a powerful and flexible way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code.
   - They are often used for tasks like logging, access control, and memoization.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   def my_decorator(func):
       def wrapper():
           print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
           func()
           print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
       return wrapper

   @my_decorator
   def say_hello():
       print("Hello!")

   say_hello()
   ```
