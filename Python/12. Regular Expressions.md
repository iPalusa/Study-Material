# 12. Regular Expressions

Pattern matching using regular expressions (regex) is a powerful technique for searching, matching, and manipulating text based on specific patterns. In Python, you can use the `re` module to work with regular expressions. Here's an overview of regular expression syntax and how to use the `re` module:

## **Regular Expression Syntax:**

Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Here are some common regex symbols and their meanings:

1. `.` (Dot): Matches any single character, except a newline.
2. `*` (Asterisk): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
3. `+` (Plus): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
4. `?` (Question Mark): Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.
5. `|` (Pipe): Acts as an OR operator to match either of two patterns.
6. `[]` (Square Brackets): Defines a character class; matches any one character in the brackets.
7. `[^]` (Caret Inside Square Brackets): Defines a negated character class; matches any character not in the brackets.
8. `()` (Parentheses): Creates a group for capturing or applying quantifiers.
9. `{}` (Curly Braces): Specifies a specific number of occurrences of the preceding character or group.
10. `\` (Backslash): Escapes special characters, making them match the literal character (e.g., `\.` matches a literal dot).

## **Using the `re` Module:**

In Python, you can use the `re` module to work with regular expressions. Here's a brief overview of how to use it:

1. Import the `re` module.
   
   ```python
   import re
   ```

2. Define a regular expression pattern using raw strings to avoid escaping issues.

   ```python
   pattern = r'\d+'  # Matches one or more digits
   ```

3. Use `re.search()` to find the first match in a string:

   ```python
   text = "The price of the product is $99.99."
   match = re.search(pattern, text)
   if match:
       print("Match found:", match.group())
   ```

4. Use `re.findall()` to find all matches in a string:

   ```python
   text = "There are 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 2 cherries."
   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
   if matches:
       print("Matches found:", matches)
   ```

5. Use `re.sub()` to replace text based on a pattern:

   ```python
   text = "The color of the car is red."
   new_text = re.sub(r'red', 'blue', text)
   print("New text:", new_text)
   ```

6. To apply flags for case-insensitive matching, multiline matching, etc., you can pass them as the second argument to functions like `re.search()`, `re.findall()`, or `re.sub()`.

   ```python
   pattern = r'red'
   text = "The color of the car is Red."
   match = re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
   if match:
       print("Match found:", match.group())
   ```
