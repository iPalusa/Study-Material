# 3.Control Flow

## **1. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else):**
   - Conditional statements allow you to execute different code blocks based on conditions.
   - The `if` statement tests a condition, and if it's true, the code block inside the `if` statement is executed.
   - The `elif` (short for "else if") statement is used to test additional conditions after the `if` condition. You can have multiple `elif` statements.
   - The `else` statement is executed if none of the conditions in the `if` and `elif` statements are true.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   age = 18
   if age < 18:
       print("You are a minor.")
   elif age == 18:
       print("You are 18 years old.")
   else:
       print("You are an adult.")
   ```

## **2. Loops (for, while):**
   - Loops are used to repeat a set of statements multiple times.
   - The `for` loop is typically used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It can iterate over sequences like lists, strings, or use the `range()` function.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   for i in range(5):  # Iterates 5 times, with i taking values 0 through 4
       print(i)
   ```
   
   - The `while` loop is used when you need to repeat an action until a condition is met.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   count = 0
   while count < 5:
       print(count)
       count += 1
   ```

## **3. Loop Control Statements (break, continue):**
   - `break` is used to exit a loop prematurely, even if the loop condition is still true.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   for i in range(10):
       if i == 5:
           break  # Stops the loop when i is 5
       print(i)
   ```
   
   - `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next one.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   for i in range(5):
       if i == 2:
           continue  # Skips the iteration when i is 2
       print(i)
   ```

## **4. Iterating Through Sequences (lists, strings, dictionaries):**
   - You can use loops to iterate through sequences like lists, strings, and dictionaries.
   
   Example with a list:
   ```python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   for fruit in fruits:
       print(fruit)
   ```
   
   Example with a string:
   ```python
   text = "Hello, Python!"
   for char in text:
       print(char)
   ```
   
   Example with a dictionary:
   ```python
   person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
   for key, value in person.items():
       print(key, ":", value)
   ```
