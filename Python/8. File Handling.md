# 8. File Handling

## **1. Opening, Reading, and Writing Files:**
   - To open a file, you can use the `open()` function, specifying the file's path and the mode (read, write, etc.).
   - To read a file, you can use methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or iterate through the file.
   - To write to a file, you can use methods like `write()` or `writelines()`.

   Example (reading a text file):
   ```python
   with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
       content = file.read()
   ```

   Example (writing to a text file):
   ```python
   with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
       file.write("Hello, World!")
   ```

## **2. File Modes (Text and Binary):**
   - When opening files, you specify a file mode that defines how the file is treated.
   - Common text modes include "r" (read), "w" (write), and "a" (append).
   - To work with binary files, you add "b" to the mode, such as "rb" (read binary) or "wb" (write binary).

## **3. Working with Directories:**
   - You can use the `os` module to interact with the file system, including creating, deleting, and listing directories.
   - The `os` module provides functions like `os.mkdir()`, `os.rmdir()`, and `os.listdir()`.

   Example (creating a directory):
   ```python
   import os
   os.mkdir("my_directory")
   ```

## **4. Exception Handling (try, except, finally):**
   - Exception handling allows you to deal with errors gracefully, preventing your program from crashing.
   - You use `try` and `except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
   - The `finally` block is used for cleanup operations that should be executed whether an exception occurs or not.

   Example:
   ```python
   try:
       # Code that may raise an exception
       num = 10 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError as e:
       # Handle the exception
       print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
   finally:
       # Cleanup operations
       print("Finally, this code is always executed.")
   ```
