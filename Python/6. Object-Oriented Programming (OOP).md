# 6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## **1. Classes and Objects:**
   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods).
   - An object is an instance of a class.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   class Dog:
       def __init__(self, name, breed):
           self.name = name
           self.breed = breed

       def bark(self):
           print(f"{self.name} barks!")

   my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
   my_dog.bark()  # Calling a method
   ```

## **2. Inheritance:**
   - Inheritance allows you to create a new class that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (the base or parent class).
   - The new class is called the derived or child class.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   class Cat(Dog):
       def purr(self):
           print(f"{self.name} purrs!")

   my_cat = Cat("Whiskers", "Siamese")
   my_cat.bark()  # Inherited method
   my_cat.purr()  # Derived method
   ```

## **3. Encapsulation:**
   - Encapsulation is the concept of restricting access to certain parts of an object, typically by using private attributes (e.g., `_variable`) and methods.
   - It helps prevent unintended modification of an object's internal state.

## **4. Polymorphism:**
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.
   - It enables more generic and flexible code.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   def animal_sound(animal):
       animal.bark()

   animal_sound(my_dog)  # Calls the Dog's bark method
   animal_sound(my_cat)  # Calls the Cat's bark method (inherited from Dog)
   ```

## **5. Abstraction:**
   - Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors.
   - It allows you to hide the implementation details and focus on the high-level functionality.

## **6. Constructors and Destructors:**
   - Constructors are special methods used for initializing objects when they are created.
   - In Python, the constructor is `__init__`.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

   person = Person("Alice", 30)
   ```
   
   - Destructors (e.g., `__del__`) are used to perform cleanup operations before an object is destroyed.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   class MyClass:
       def __del__(self):
           print("Object destroyed")

   obj = MyClass()
   del obj  # Explicitly destroy the object
   ```
