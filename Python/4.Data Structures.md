# 4. Data Structures

## **1. Lists:**
   - Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type.
   - Lists are created using square brackets (`[]`) and elements are separated by commas.
   - You can add, remove, and modify elements in a list.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"]
   ```

## **2. Tuples:**
   - Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
   - Tuples are created using parentheses (`()`) and elements are separated by commas.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana")
   ```

## **3. Sets:**
   - Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
   - Sets are created using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor.
   - Sets are useful for finding unique values in a collection.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4}  # Duplicate values are automatically removed
   ```

## **4. Dictionaries:**
   - Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
   - Dictionaries are created using curly braces `{}` or the `dict()` constructor.
   - Keys must be unique and are used to access their associated values.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
   ```

## **5. List Comprehensions:**
   - List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists.
   - They are a compact and readable way to transform and filter data.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
   ```

## **6. Slicing and Indexing:**
   - Slicing allows you to extract a portion of a list, string, or tuple.
   - Indexing is used to access individual elements of a sequence.
   
   Example with a list:
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   first_three = my_list[:3]  # Slicing
   third_element = my_list[2]  # Indexing
   ```
