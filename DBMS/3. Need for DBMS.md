# Need For DBMS:

### 1. **Challenges of Traditional File-Based Systems:**
   - Traditional file-based systems pose several challenges in managing and organizing data efficiently.
   - These systems lack the centralized control and structure offered by database management systems.

### 2. **Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:**
   - In file-based systems, data is often duplicated across multiple files, leading to redundancy.
   - Redundancy increases the likelihood of inconsistencies, as updating data in one file may not be reflected in others.

### 3. **Data Isolation and Concurrent Access Issues:**
   - Traditional systems make it challenging to share and access data concurrently.
   - Data isolation occurs when different departments or users maintain separate, isolated sets of data, hindering collaboration and data consistency.
