# 3. Layout and Containers

## **3.1. Container Component:**

The Container component in Tailwind CSS is a predefined element that provides a responsive container for your content. It helps maintain a consistent width for your content across different screen sizes.

Example:
```html
<div class="container mx-auto">
  <!-- Your content goes here -->
</div>
```

In the above example, `container` is a Tailwind CSS class that centers the content and limits its width. The `mx-auto` class is used to horizontally center the container.

## **3.2. Grid System:**

Tailwind CSS provides a flexible grid system that allows you to create grid layouts for your content. You can define the number of columns and the column spacing as per your design requirements.

Example:
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4">Column 1</div>
  <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4">Column 2</div>
  <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4">Column 3</div>
</div>
```

In the above example, `grid-cols-3` specifies a 3-column layout, and `gap-4` adds a gap of `1rem` between the columns. Each column contains content with a gray background, padding, and other utility classes as needed.

## **3.3. Flexbox Utilities:**

Tailwind CSS provides a set of utility classes for working with Flexbox, making it easy to create flexible and responsive layouts.

Example:
```html
<div class="flex flex-row">
  <div class="flex-1 bg-blue-200 p-4">Flex Item 1</div>
  <div class="flex-1 bg-green-200 p-4">Flex Item 2</div>
  <div class="flex-1 bg-yellow-200 p-4">Flex Item 3</div>
</div>
```

In this example, the `flex` class is applied to the container, creating a horizontal flex container. Each flex item gets an equal amount of space using the `flex-1` class.

## **3.4. Width and Height Utilities:**

Tailwind CSS provides a variety of classes for setting the width and height of elements, both in fixed and relative units. You can set these properties for containers, images, or any other HTML element.

Example:
```html
<div class="w-64 h-32 bg-purple-200">Fixed Width and Height</div>
```

In this example, the `w-64` sets the width to `16rem`, and `h-32` sets the height to `8rem`. The element has a purple background.

## **3.5. Space Utilities (e.g., gap, margin, padding):**

Tailwind CSS offers utility classes for controlling spacing. You can set margins and padding with various values and units. The `gap` utility is commonly used for managing space between grid or flex items.

Example:
```html
<div class="p-4">
  <div class="m-2 bg-red-200">Item 1</div>
  <div class="m-2 bg-blue-200">Item 2</div>
  <div class="m-2 bg-green-200">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

In this example, `p-4` sets padding on the container. The `m-2` class is used for margin on each item, and different background colors are applied to demonstrate the effect.
