# 4. Typography and Text


## **4.1. Text and Font Utilities:**
   - Text and font utilities in Tailwind CSS allow you to control the appearance of text elements, such as changing the font family, text size, and text color.
   - You can use classes like `text-{size}`, `font-{family}`, and `text-{color}` to adjust the text properties.

   Example:
   ```html
   <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-700">This is a styled text.</p>
   ```

## **4.2. Headings and Paragraphs:**
   - This section covers styling headings and paragraphs. Tailwind CSS provides classes to adjust the size, font weight, and color of headings and paragraphs.
   - Classes like `text-2xl`, `font-bold`, and `text-gray-600` can be used to style headings and paragraphs.

   Example:
   ```html
   <h1 class="text-3xl font-extrabold text-purple-900">Large Heading</h1>
   <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500">A simple paragraph of text.</p>
   ```

## **4.3. Text Alignment:**
   - Text alignment utilities enable you to control the alignment of text within its container. You can align text to the left, center, right, or justify it.
   - Classes like `text-left`, `text-center`, `text-right`, and `text-justify` are used for text alignment.

   Example:
   ```html
   <p class="text-center">This text is centered.</p>
   <p class="text-right">This text is aligned to the right.</p>
   ```

## **4.4. Text Decoration:**
   - Text decoration utilities allow you to add visual effects to text, such as underlining, overlining, or striking through text.
   - Classes like `underline`, `line-through`, and `no-underline` are used for text decoration.

   Example:
   ```html
   <p class="underline">This text is underlined.</p>
   <p class="line-through">This text has a line through it.</p>
   <p class="no-underline">This text has no underline.</p>
   ```

## **4.5. Line Height and Leading Utilities:**
   - Line height (leading) utilities control the space between lines of text. They can be used to adjust text readability and appearance.
   - Classes like `leading-{size}` are used to set the line height.

   Example:
   ```html
   <p class="leading-6">This text has increased line height.</p>
   <p class="leading-8">This text has even more line height.</p>
   ```
