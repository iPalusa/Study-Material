# 3.1 Creating Tuples
A tuple is a collection of ordered, immutable and heterogeneous elements. Tuples are similar to lists, but the main difference is that tuples cannot be modified once they are created. This means that you cannot add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple after it is created.
```python
# Empty tuple
my_tuple = ()
print(my_tuple)   # Output: ()

# Tuple with one element
my_tuple = (1,)
print(my_tuple)   # Output: (1,) 

# Tuple with multiple elements
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0)
print(my_tuple)   # Output: (1, 2, 3, 'four', 5.0)
```

# 3.2 Accessing Tuples
You can access elements of a tuple in Python using indexing, just like you would with a list.

# 3.3 Tuple Packing & Unpacking
1. **Tuple Packing**: When we create a tuple, we pack a sequence of values into it. This is known as tuple packing
```python
my_tuple = 1, 2, 3
print(my_tuple)   # Output: (1, 2, 3)
```

1. **Tuple Unpacking**: We can also unpack a tuple by assigning its elements to separate variables. This is known as tuple unpacking.
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
a, b, c = my_tuple
print(a)   # Output: 1
print(b)   # Output: 2
print(c)   # Output: 3

# you can use the special syntax * to collect the remaining elements of the tuple into a list.  
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
a, b, *rest = my_tuple
print(a)      # Output: 1
print(b)      # Output: 2
print(rest)   # Output: [3, 4, 5]
```

# 3.4 Tuple Slicing
Tuple slicing is the process of extracting a part of a tuple by specifying a range of indices. Slicing tuples is very similar to slicing lists in Python.
```python
#Syntax
tuple[start:stop:step]
```

where:
- **start** is the index of the first element you want to include in the slice (inclusive).
- **stop** is the index of the first element you want to exclude from the slice (exclusive).
- **step** is the stride or step size.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# Slice from index 2 to index 4 (exclusive)
print(my_tuple[2:4])    # Output: (3, 4)

# Slice from the beginning to index 3 (exclusive)
print(my_tuple[:3])     # Output: (1, 2, 3)

# Slice from index 3 to the end
print(my_tuple[3:])     # Output: (4, 5, 6) 

# Slice from the beginning to the end, with a step of 2
print(my_tuple[::2])    # Output: (1, 3, 5) 

# Reverse the tuple using slicing
print(my_tuple[::-1])   # Output: (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
```

# 3.5  Tuple Concatenation
Tuple concatenation is the process of combining two or more tuples into a single tuple. You can concatenate tuples using the + operator.
```python
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = (4, 5, 6)
t3 = t1 + t2
print(t3)   # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

# 3.6   Converting other data types to tuples
```python
# Converting a list to a tuple:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print(my_tuple)   # Output: (1, 2, 3)  

# Converting a string to a tuple:
my_string = "hello"
my_tuple = tuple(my_string)
print(my_tuple)   # Output: ('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')

# Converting a range object to a tuple:
my_range = range(5)
my_tuple = tuple(my_range)
print(my_tuple)   # Output: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

# Converting a dictionary to a tuple (the resulting tuple will contain only the keys of the dictionary):
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
my_tuple = tuple(my_dict)
print(my_tuple)   # Output: ('a', 'b', 'c')
```

# 3.7 Tuple Functions
```python
# enumerate(): Returns an iterable object that contains tuples of the form (index, element) for each element in a tuple.
my_tuple = ('a', 'b', 'c')
for index, element in enumerate(my_tuple):
    print(index, element)
# Output:
# 0 a
# 1 b
# 2 c

# zip(): Returns an iterable object that contains tuples of the form (element1, element2, ...) for elements with the same index in multiple tuples.
my_tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
my_tuple2 = ('a', 'b', 'c')
my_zip = zip(my_tuple1, my_tuple2)
for element in my_zip:
    print(element)
# Output:
# (1, 'a')
# (2, 'b')
# (3, 'c')

# reversed(): Returns an iterable object that contains the elements of a tuple in reverse order.
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3
my_reversed_tuple = reversed(my_tuple)
for element in my_reversed_tuple:
    print(element)
# Output:
# 3
# 2
# 1

# any(): Returns True if at least one element of a tuple is True, and False otherwise.
my_tuple = (False, True, False)
print(any(my_tuple))   # Output: True

# all(): Returns True if all elements of a tuple are True, and False otherwise.
my_tuple = (True, True, False)
print(all(my_tuple))   # Output: False

# len(): Returns the number of elements in a tuple.
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(len(my_tuple))   # Output: 3

# max(): Returns the largest element in a tuple.
my_tuple = (1, 5, 3)
print(max(my_tuple))   # Output: 5

# min(): Returns the smallest element in a tuple.
my_tuple = (1, 5, 3)
print(min(my_tuple))   # Output: 1

# sum(): Returns the sum of all elements in a tuple.
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(sum(my_tuple))   # Output: 6
