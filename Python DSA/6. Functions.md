# 6.1 Defining Functions
---
The syntax of defining a function in Python is as follows:

```python
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
    """
    Docstring: This is a brief description of the function.
    It can span multiple lines and explains what the function does,
    its parameters and return value(s).
    """
    # code to be executed
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
    return value(s)  # optional
```

Let's break down the different parts of the function definition:

- `def` keyword: This keyword is used to start the definition of a function.
- `function_name`: This is the name of the function and should follow the same naming conventions as variable names. It should also be descriptive of what the function does.
- `parameter1`, `parameter2`, ...: These are the parameters or arguments that the function takes. Parameters are optional and can be used to pass data to the function for it to use.
- Docstring: This is a string that comes immediately after the function definition and is used to provide documentation for the function. It is optional but highly recommended for good programming practices.
- Comments: These are used to explain the code within the function body. They can be used to provide further detail or to make the code more readable.
- `return` statement: This is optional and is used to return a value from the function to the caller. If there is no return statement, the function will return `None` by default.

Here's an example of a function that takes two parameters and returns their sum:

```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
    """
    sum = num1 + num2
    return sum
```


# 6.2 Functional Arguments
---
Functional arguments refer to the different ways in which arguments can be passed to a function.

1. **Positional arguments:** These are the arguments passed to a function in the order they are defined in the function's parameter list.

```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    sum = num1 + num2
    return sum

result = add_numbers(3, 4)
print(result) # Output: 7
```

2. **Keyword arguments:** These arguments are identified by their parameter name and are passed in the form of `parameter=value`. This allows the caller to specify which argument corresponds to which parameter, regardless of the order.

In this code we used f character, An f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with the letter `f` or `F`, and it can contain expressions inside curly braces `{}`. When an f-string is evaluated, the expressions inside the curly braces are evaluated and their values are inserted into the string.

```python
def greet(name, greeting):
    message = f"{greeting}, {name}!"
    return message

result = greet(name="Alice", greeting="Hello")
print(result) # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

3. **Default arguments:** These are arguments that have a default value assigned to them in the function definition. If the caller does not pass a value for these arguments, the default value is used. Default arguments are used to make some parameters optional. For example:

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    message = f"{greeting}, {name}!"
    return message

result1 = greet(name="Alice")
result2 = greet(name="Bob", greeting="Hi")

print(result1) # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(result2) # Output: Hi, Bob!
```

4. **Variable-length arguments:** 
- Variable length arguments allow a function to receive an arbitrary number of arguments, which can be useful in situations where you don't know in advance how many arguments will be passed to the function.
- This is sometimes referred to as "***varargs***" or "***var-args***" for short.
- Variable length arguments are denoted in Python with an asterisk `*` before the argument name. This tells Python that the function should expect a variable number of arguments, which will be collected into a tuple.

```python
def sum_numbers(*args):
    total = 0
    for num in args:
        total += num
    return total

result = sum_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(result) # Output: 15
```

In this example, `*args` is used to pass a variable number of positional arguments. The function `sum_numbers` can accept any number of arguments and calculates the sum of all of them.

### `**kwargs`
- It is a way to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. The term "kwargs" stands for "keyword arguments". 
- When you use `**kwargs` in a function definition, it means that any additional keyword arguments that are not explicitly defined in the function signature will be captured and packed into a dictionary called `kwargs`.
- In below example `name` and `age` are explicitly defined as positional arguments, and any additional keyword arguments will be captured in the `kwargs` dictionary.
```python
def print_info(name, age, **kwargs):
    print(f"Name: {name}")
    print(f"Age: {age}")
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_info("Alice", 30, city="New York", occupation="Engineer")

"""
Name: Alice
Age: 30
city: New York
occupation: Engineer
"""
```

# 6.3 Function Scope and Namespace
---
**Local variable:**
- A local variable is one that is defined inside a function and is only accessible within that function.
```python
def print_message():
    message = "Hello, world!"
    print(message)
```

**Global variable:**
- A global variable is defined outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
```python
count = 0

def increment_count():
    global count
    count += 1
    print("Count is now:", count)
```

**nonlocal keyword:**
- The `nonlocal` keyword is similar to `global`, but it is used to refer to a variable in the enclosing scope of a nested function.
```python
def outer():
    x = 1

    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x += 1
        print("Inner x is now:", x)

    inner()
    print("Outer x is now:", x)
```
- Without the `nonlocal` keyword, Python would create a new local variable called `x` inside `inner()` and leave the variable in `outer()` unchanged.

**LEGB rule:**
- The LEGB rule is a concept that explains how Python resolves variable names in a program. 
- It stands for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in, which are four scopes where Python searches for variables in the order of the acronym.
- The Enclosing scope includes variables that are defined in the enclosing function, and they can be accessed from within the nested function.
- When a variable is used in a program, Python first checks the Local scope for the variable. If the variable is not found in the Local scope, Python then checks the Enclosing scope, followed by the Global scope, and finally the Built-in scope. If the variable is not found in any of these scopes, Python raises a NameError.

## Namespace
- A namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers (such as variable names, function names, and class names) and their corresponding objects. It's a way to organize and distinguish between different sets of names in a program, preventing naming conflicts and making it easier to understand and maintain code.
- Every namespace in Python has a unique name, and the same name can refer to different objects in different namespaces. 
- For example, if we define a variable `x` in a function, it will have a different namespace than if we define it outside of a function. This means that we can have two variables with the same name in different namespaces, and they will not conflict with each other.

```python
x = 5  # global namespace
def foo():
    y = 10  # local namespace
    print(x, y)
foo()  # prints 5 10
```

# 6.4 Lambda Functions
---
- A lambda function is a small anonymous function that can be defined on the fly without a name. 
- They are also known as *anonymous functions* because they don't have a formal name like a regular function.
- We use lambda functions, let's say we have a list of integers and we want to sort them in descending order. You could use the built-in `sorted()` function to do this, along with a lambda function.

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
add(2, 3)
#5
```

```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: -x)
print(sorted_numbers)
```

# 6.5 Recursion
---
- Recursion refers to the process of a function calling itself. 
- It is used to solve complex problems in a simple and elegant way.
- The basic idea of recursion is to break down a problem into smaller sub-problems that can be solved recursively. Each recursive call works on a smaller sub-problem until a base case is reached, at which point the recursion stops and the results are combined to solve the original problem.
- **base case:** The base case is the condition that determines when the recursion should stop. It's the simplest possible case that can be solved without recursion.
- **recursive case:** The recursive case is the part of the algorithm that breaks down the problem into smaller sub-problems and calls the function recursively to solve them.
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
        factorial(3)
        #6
```
In this example, the base case is when `n == 1`. When `n == 1`, the function simply returns 1, which is the factorial of 1. The recursive case is when `n > 1`. In this case, the function multiplies `n` by the result of calling `factorial(n-1)`. This means that the factorial of `n` is equal to `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`. This process continues until the base case is reached.

# 6.6 Decorators
---
Decorators are a way of modifying or enhancing the behavior of a function or a class in Python. They are a feature of Python that allows you to add functionality to an existing function or class without modifying the code directly. 

Here is an overview of the concepts related to decorators in Python:

1. **Syntax of decorators:**
- A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function.
- The "@" symbol is used to apply a decorator to a function or class.

2. **Applying decorators to functions:**
- A decorator can be used to modify the behavior of a function by wrapping the original function with additional functionality.
- The decorator function is applied to the original function using the "@" symbol.

3. **Decorators with arguments:**
- A decorator can also take arguments to modify its behavior.
- The decorator function takes the arguments, which can be used to customize the behavior of the wrapped function.

Here is an example of how to use decorators in Python:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Before function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def my_function():
    print("Function is called.")

my_function()
```

In this example, the `my_decorator` function is defined to take a function as an argument, and it returns a new function (`wrapper`) that adds some behavior before and after the original function is called. The decorator function is applied to the `my_function` function using the "@" symbol, which modifies the behavior of the function by adding the behavior defined in the `my_decorator` function.

Decorators can also take arguments, like this:

```python
def repeat(num_repeats):
    def repeat_decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for i in range(num_repeats):
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return result
        return wrapper
    return repeat_decorator

@repeat(3)
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello()
```

In this example, the `repeat` function is defined to take an argument (`num_repeats`), which specifies how many times the decorated function should be called. The `repeat` function returns another function (`repeat_decorator`) that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`) that calls the original function multiple times. The decorator function is applied to the `hello` function using the "@" symbol, which modifies the behavior of the function by repeating the original behavior multiple times.

# 6.7 Built-in Functions
---
Built-in functions in Python are pre-defined functions that are available in the Python interpreter. These functions can be called directly without the need for importing any external modules or libraries.

Here are some examples of commonly used built-in functions in Python:

1. `print()` - Used to output text or variables to the console.
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

2. `len()` - Returns the length of a string, list, tuple, dictionary, or set.
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(len(my_list))
```

3. `type()` - Returns the data type of a variable or object.
```python
my_string = "Hello, world!"
print(type(my_string))
```

4. `range()` - Returns a sequence of numbers from a start value (inclusive) to an end value (exclusive).
```python
my_range = range(1, 6)
print(list(my_range))
```

5. `sorted()` - Returns a sorted list of items.
```python
my_list = [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]
print(sorted(my_list))
```

6. `sum()` - Returns the sum of all the elements in a list.
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum(my_list))
```

7. `input()` - Reads a line of text from the console.
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

In addition to these examples, there are many other built-in functions available in Python. You can get a full list of built-in functions and their descriptions by using the `help()` function. The `help()` function provides documentation for all Python functions, including the built-in functions.

For example, to get help on the `len()` function, you can use the following code:
```python
help(len)
```

This will print out the documentation for the `len()` function, which includes a description of what the function does, how to use it, and what arguments it takes.

# 6.8 Modules and Packages
---
In Python, modules are files that contain Python code, and packages are collections of modules. Modules and packages allow you to organize your code into reusable units and make it easier to maintain and share your code with others.

Here are some concepts related to modules and packages in Python:

1. **Importing modules:** You can import a module in Python using the `import` statement. For example, to import the `math` module, you would use the following code:
```python
import math
```

2. **Using modules and functions from modules:** Once you have imported a module, you can use its functions and variables by prefixing them with the module name. For example, to use the `sqrt()` function from the `math` module, you would use the following code:
```python
import math
x = math.sqrt(25)
print(x)
```

3. **Creating and importing packages:** To create a package in Python, you need to create a directory with an `__init__.py` file. The `__init__.py` file can be empty or can contain initialization code for the package. For example, suppose you have a directory called `mypackage` with an empty `__init__.py` file. To import a module called `mymodule` from the `mypackage` package, you would use the following code:
```python
import mypackage.mymodule
```

4. ***The __init__.py file:*** The `__init__.py` file is a special file that is executed when a package is imported. It can contain initialization code for the package, as well as define which modules are part of the package. For example, suppose you have a directory called `mypackage` with the following `__init__.py` file:
```python
from . import mymodule1
from . import mymodule2
```
This code specifies that the `mypackage` package contains two modules: `mymodule1` and `mymodule2`.

# 6.9 Errors and Exceptions
---
In Python, errors and exceptions are two types of problems that can occur during the execution of a program. Syntax errors occur when there is a problem with the code itself, such as a missing parenthesis or a misspelled keyword. Exceptions, on the other hand, occur when the code is syntactically correct, but there is a problem during the execution of the code, such as a division by zero or an attempt to access a non-existent file.

Here are some concepts related to errors and exceptions in Python:

1. **Syntax errors vs. exceptions:** Syntax errors occur when there is a problem with the syntax of the code, such as a missing parenthesis or a misspelled keyword. Exceptions, on the other hand, occur when the code is syntactically correct, but there is a problem during the execution of the code.

2. **Common exceptions in Python:** Some common exceptions in Python include `ZeroDivisionError` (raised when there is a division by zero), `TypeError` (raised when there is a type mismatch), `ValueError` (raised when a function is called with an inappropriate argument value), and `FileNotFoundError` (raised when a file is not found).

3. **Handling exceptions with try...except blocks:** You can handle exceptions in Python using try...except blocks. A try block contains the code that might raise an exception, while an except block contains the code that is executed when an exception is raised. For example, to handle a `ZeroDivisionError` exception, you could use the following code:
```python
try:
    x = 1/0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
```

4. The finally block: In addition to try and except blocks, you can also use a finally block to specify code that is executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. For example, you could use the following code to ensure that a file is closed regardless of whether an exception is raised:
```python
try:
    f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
    # Do something with the file
finally:
    f.close()
```

# 6.10 Advanced Function Topics
---

## Function annotations:
Function annotations are a way to attach metadata to the parameters and return values of functions. This metadata is not enforced by the Python interpreter, but it can be used by tools like IDEs and linters to provide additional information about how functions should be used. Here's an example:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

In this example, the function `greet` takes a parameter called `name`, which is expected to be a string. The function also returns a string. These types are specified using function annotations.

## Function overloading:
Function overloading is a way to define multiple functions with the same name, but with different parameter types or numbers of parameters. This allows you to provide different implementations of a function based on the types of the arguments passed to it. Here's an example:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

def add(x: float, y: float) -> float:
    return x + y
```

In this example, there are two different implementations of the `add` function. One takes two integer arguments and returns an integer, while the other takes two float arguments and returns a float.

## Function templates:
Function templates, also known as generic functions, are a way to define functions that can work with multiple different types of data. In Python, you can use the `typing` module to define generic types that can be used as placeholders for any data type. Here's an example:

```python
from typing import List, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')

def first(items: List[T]) -> T:
    return items[0]
```

In this example, the function `first` takes a list of items of an unspecified type (`List[T]`) and returns the first item of that list (`T`). The `TypeVar` function is used to define a generic type variable `T`, which can be replaced with any type when the function is called.

## Closures and nested functions:
Closures and nested functions are related concepts that involve defining functions inside other functions. A closure is a function that has access to the variables in the outer (enclosing) function's scope, even after the outer function has returned. Here's an example:

```python
def make_counter():
    count = 0
    
    def counter():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    
    return counter
```

In this example, the `make_counter` function defines a nested function called `counter`. The `counter` function has access to the `count` variable in the outer `make_counter` function's scope, and can modify it even after `make_counter` has returned. The `make_counter` function returns the `counter` function as its result.
