# 1.1 List Creation and Initialization

List Creation and Initialization refers to the process of creating a new list object and adding elements to it. In Python, a list is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable, and it can contain elements of different data types.

Here are a few ways to create and initialize a list in Python:

### 1. **Using square brackets []:**
We can create a new empty list by assigning a pair of empty square brackets to a variable. We can also create a list with initial values by enclosing a comma-separated list of values inside square brackets.
```python
# Creating an empty list
my_list = []

# Creating a list with initial values
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
mixed = [1, 'apple', True]
```

### 2. **Using the list() constructor:**
We can create a new list by calling the list() constructor with an iterable as an argument. The iterable can be a range object, another list, tuple, string, etc.
```python
# Creating a list from a range object
my_list = list(range(1, 6)) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating a list from another list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits_copy = list(fruits) # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Creating a list from a string
my_string = 'hello'
my_list = list(my_string) # Output: ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

# 1.2 List Indexing

List Indexing refers to the process of accessing individual elements of a list by their position or index. In Python, list indexing starts at 0 for the first element and goes up to n-1 for the nth element of the list.
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi"]
print(fruits[0])    # output: "apple"
print(fruits[2])    # output: "orange"
```

# 1.3 List Slicing

List Slicing refers to the process of accessing a subset or segment of a list by specifying a range of indices. In Python, list slicing is done using the colon : operator. The first index is the starting point of the slice and the second index is the endpoint of the slice.
```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(numbers[2:6])    # output: [2, 3, 4, 5]

# Slicing can also be done with a third argument, which specifies the step size of the slice.
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(numbers[::2])    # output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# Reverse slicing: This involves slicing the list in reverse order. The syntax is list[::-1].
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_sliced = numbers[::-1]
print(reversed_sliced)    # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# Slicing with negative indices: This involves using negative indices to slice the list. The syntax is list[-end:-start].
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sliced = numbers[-3:-1]
print(sliced)    # Output: [3, 4]

# Slicing with partial indexing: This involves omitting either the start or end index, which defaults to the beginning or end of the list respectively. The syntax is list[start:] or list[:end].
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sliced1 = numbers[2:]
sliced2 = numbers[:3]
print(sliced1)    # Output: [3, 4, 5]
print(sliced2)    # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

# 1.4 List Operations

### 1. **Adding List Elements**

```python
# Define an empty list
fruits = []

# Add a single element to the list using append()
fruits.append("apple")

# Add multiple elements to the list using extend()
fruits.extend(["banana", "orange"])
print(fruits)    # Output: ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# The insert() method in Python allows you to insert an element at a specific position in a list.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
fruits.insert(1, "grape")
print(fruits)    # Output: ["apple", "grape", "banana", "orange"]
```

### 2. **Removing List Elements**

```python
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Remove an element by value using remove()
numbers.remove(3)

# Remove an element by index using pop()
numbers.pop(0)
print(numbers)    # Output: [2, 4, 5]
```

### 3. **Sorting**
You can sort a list using the sort() method, which sorts the list in place, or the sorted() function, which returns a new sorted list.
```python
#sort()
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)    # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]

#sorted()
letters = ["d", "b", "a", "c"]
sorted_letters = sorted(letters)
print(sorted_letters)    # Output: ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```

### 4. **Reversing** 

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)    # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

### 5. **Checking Membership**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print("banana" in fruits)    # Output: True
print("kiwi" in fruits)    # Output: False
```

# 1.5  List Comprehensions

List comprehensions are a concise and elegant way to create a new list based on an existing list in Python. List comprehensions allow you to create a new list by applying a transformation or filtering elements from an existing list.
```python
#Syntax
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

Where:
-   `new_list`: the new list that will be created
-   `expression`: the operation or transformation that will be applied to each item in the iterable
-   `item`: the variable that represents each item in the iterable
-   `iterable`: the existing list that will be transformed or filtered
-   `condition`: an optional condition that filters the items in the iterable

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [n**2 for n in numbers]
print(squares)    # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Filtering even numbers from a list using a list comprehension
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)    # Output: [2, 4]
```

# 1.6 Nested Lists

A nested list is a list that contains other lists as its elements. This means that the elements of a list can be other lists, which can then contain more lists, and so on.

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Accessing the element in row 1, column 2
print(matrix[0][1])    # Output: 2

# Accessing the element in row 3, column 3
print(matrix[2][2])    # Output: 9

# Adding an element to a nested list
matrix[1].append(7)
print(matrix)    # Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7], [7, 8, 9]]

# Removing an element from a nested list
matrix[0].remove(2)
print(matrix)    # Output: [[1, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7], [7, 8, 9]]

# Adding multiple elements to the inner list at index 0
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
nested_list[0].extend([4, 5, 6])
print(nested_list)    # Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Removing the first two elements from the inner list at index 0
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
nested_list[0] = nested_list[0][2:]
print(nested_list)    # Output: [[3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

# 1.7 List Iteration

Iterating over a list means going through each element of the list one by one.
```python
# The for in loop in Python is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence such as a list, tuple, or string

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# 2. You can also use the range() function with the len() function to iterate over a list using indices.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print("Index", i, "contains", fruits[i])
```

# 1.8 List Membership

You can check if an element is a member of a list using the in and not in operators.
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
if "banana" in fruits:
    print("Yes, banana is a fruit!")
else:
    print("No, banana is not a fruit.")
    
# 2
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
if "grape" not in fruits:
    print("Yes, grape is not a fruit!")
else:
    print("No, grape is a fruit.")
```

# 1.9  List Comparision

you can compare two lists using the comparison operators ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=.
```python
# 1
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

if list1 == list2:
    print("The lists are equal.")
else:
    print("The lists are not equal.")

# 2
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]

if list1 != list2:
    print("The lists are not equal.")
else:
    print("The lists are equal.")

# 3
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 4]

if list1 < list2:
    print("list1 is less than list2.")
else:
    print("list1 is greater than or equal to list2.")
```

# 1.10 List Aliasing and Cloning

When you create a list and assign it to a variable, you are creating a reference to that list. An alias is when you create a new variable that refers to the same list. This can be useful, but can also lead to unexpected results if you're not careful.
```python
# List Aliasing
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = list1
list1.append(4)
print(list1)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(list2)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# To avoid list aliasing, you can create a clone of a list, which is a copy of the original list with its own reference. There are several ways to clone a list in Python
# Using the slice operator
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = list1[:]
list1.append(4)
print(list1)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(list2)  # [1, 2, 3]

# Using the list() constructor
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = list(list1)
list1.append(4)
print(list1)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(list2)  # [1, 2, 3]

# Using the copy() method
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = list1.copy()
list1.append(4)
print(list1)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(list2)  # [1, 2, 3]
