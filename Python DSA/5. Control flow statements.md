Control flow statements in Python are used to control the execution of code based on certain conditions or to repeatedly execute a block of code. Here are the main control flow statements in Python with examples:

### if statement

The `if` statement is used to check if a condition is true and execute a block of code if it is. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

In this example, we check if the variable `x` is greater than 5 using the `>` operator. If the condition is true, the code inside the `if` block is executed and the message "x is greater than 5" is printed to the console.

### if-else statement

The `if-else` statement is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and a different block of code if it is false. Here's an example:

```python
x = 4

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

In this example, we check if the variable `x` is greater than 5 using the `>` operator. If the condition is true, the code inside the first `if` block is executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the `else` block is executed instead. The output of this code would be "x is less than or equal to 5".

### if-elif-else statement

The `if-elif-else` statement is used to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code depending on which condition is true. Here's an example:

```python
x = 7

if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
elif x < 10:
    print("x is between 5 and 10")
else:
    print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
```

In this example, we check if the variable `x` is less than 5 using the `<` operator. If the condition is true, the code inside the first `if` block is executed. If the condition is false, we check if `x` is less than 10 using the second `elif` statement. If that condition is true, the code inside the `elif` block is executed. If both conditions are false, the code inside the `else` block is executed. The output of this code would be "x is between 5 and 10".

### while loop

The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code while a condition is true. Here's an example:

```python
i = 0

while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

In this example, we initialize a variable `i` to 0, and then use a `while` loop to repeatedly print the value of `i` as long as it is less than 5. Inside the loop, we increment the value of `i` by 1 using the `+=` operator. The output of this code would be the numbers 0 through 4 printed to the console.

### for loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of values and execute a block of code for each value. Here's an example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

Apologies for the incomplete answer. Here's the complete example for the for loop:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

In this example, we create a list of fruits and then use a `for` loop to iterate over the list and print each fruit to the console. The variable `fruit` takes on the value of each element in the list in turn, starting with "apple", then "banana", and finally "cherry". The output of this code would be:

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

### break statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, even if the loop condition has not been met. Here's an example:

```python
i = 0

while True:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i == 5:
        break
```

In this example, we use a `while` loop with an infinite condition (`True`) to repeatedly print the value of `i` and increment it by 1. However, we use an `if` statement to check if `i` has reached the value of 5, and if it has, we use the `break` statement to exit the loop immediately. The output of this code would be the numbers 0 through 4 printed to the console.

### continue statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip over the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next one. Here's an example:

```python
i = 0

while i < 5:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

In this example, we use a `while` loop to iterate over the numbers 1 through 5. However, we use an `if` statement to check if `i` is equal to 3, and if it is, we use the `continue` statement to skip over that iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. The output of this code would be:

```
1
2
4
5
```

This is because the number 3 is skipped over due to the `continue` statement, but the other numbers are printed normally.
