# 4.1 Introduction to Sets
---
In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. The elements in a set can be of any data type, such as numbers, strings, or even other sets. Sets are denoted by enclosing a comma-separated list of elements within curly braces `{}`. Here is an example of creating a set in Python:

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

In this example, `my_set` is a set containing the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Note that the order in which the elements appear in the set is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which they were defined. Additionally, since sets only contain unique elements, duplicates are automatically removed. For example:

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}
print(my_set)
```

Output:
```python
{1, 2, 3}
```

Here, the duplicates 2 and 3 were automatically removed when the set was created. This is one of the key features of sets in Python.

## Properties of Sets:
In Python, sets have several properties that make them a useful and powerful data structure. Here are some of the key properties of sets in Python:

1. **Unordered:** Sets are unordered, meaning that the elements in a set have no particular order. This is different from lists, which have a specific order based on their position in the list.

2. **Unique Elements:** Sets contain only unique elements. If you try to add an element that already exists in the set, it will not be added again.

3. **Mutable:** Sets are mutable, meaning that you can add or remove elements from a set after it has been created.

4. **Iterability:** Sets are iterable, meaning that you can loop through the elements in a set using a for loop.

5. **Heterogeneous Elements:** Sets can contain elements of different types, including integers, strings, and other objects.

6. **Operations:** Sets support various operations, such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

7. **Fast Membership Testing:** Sets provide fast membership testing. This means that you can quickly check if an element is in a set or not.

8. **No Duplicates:** Because sets only contain unique elements, they are a useful data structure for removing duplicates from a list or other collection.

9. **Hashable Elements:** Elements in a set must be hashable, meaning that they have a unique hash value that can be used to compare them with other elements in the set.

# 4.2 Creating Sets
---

1. **Using the `set()` Function:**
You can create a set using the `set()` function in Python. The `set()` function takes an iterable (e.g. a list, tuple, or string) as an argument and returns a set containing the unique elements of the iterable. Here's an example:

```python
# Creating a set using the set() function
my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(my_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

In this example, we pass a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to the `set()` function, which returns a set containing the unique elements of the list.

2. **Using Curly Braces {}:**
You can also create a set using curly braces `{}`. When you use curly braces to create a set, you can include the elements of the set separated by commas. Here's an example:

```python
# Creating a set using curly braces
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(my_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

# 4.3  Accessing Elements of Sets
---

1. **Using the `in` Keyword:**
You can use the `in` keyword to check if an element is in a set. The `in` keyword returns a boolean value `True` if the element is in the set, and `False` otherwise. Here's an example:

```python
# Accessing elements of a set using the 'in' keyword
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
if 3 in my_set:
    print("3 is in the set")
else:
    print("3 is not in the set")
```

2. **Using Loops:**
You can also use loops to access the elements of a set. Here's an example:

```python
# Accessing elements of a set using a loop
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
for element in my_set:
    print(element)
```

3. **Using the `index()` Method:**
The `index()` method is not available in sets in Python, since sets are unordered and do not have a specific order of elements. If you need to access a specific element in a set, you can convert the set to a list and then use the `index()` method on the list. However, keep in mind that the order of the elements in the list is not guaranteed to be the same as the order of the elements in the original set.

```python
# Converting a set to a list and using the 'index()' method
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_list = list(my_set)
index = my_list.index(3)
print(index) # Output: 2
```

In this example, we convert the set `my_set` to a list using the `list()` function, and then use the `index()` method to get the index of the element `3` in the list. The output will be `2`, which is the index of `3` in the list.

# 4.4 Modifying Sets
---
## Adding Elements to a Set

1. **Using the `add()` Method:**
You can add a single element to a set using the `add()` method. The `add()` method takes one argument, which is the element you want to add to the set. Here's an example:

```python
# Adding a single element to a set using the 'add()' method
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_set.add(6)
print(my_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
```

2. **Using the `update()` Method:**
You can add multiple elements to a set using the `update()` method. The `update()` method takes one or more iterables as arguments, and adds all the elements from the iterables to the set. Here's an example:

```python
# Adding multiple elements to a set using the 'update()' method
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_set.update([6, 7, 8])
print(my_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```

## Removing Elements in Sets

1. **Using the `remove()` Method:**
You can remove a specific element from a set using the `remove()` method. The `remove()` method takes one argument, which is the element you want to remove from the set. If the element is not in the set, the `remove()` method will raise a `KeyError` exception. Here's an example:

```python
# Removing a specific element from a set using the 'remove()' method
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_set.remove(3)
print(my_set) # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

2. **Using the `discard()` Method:**
You can also remove a specific element from a set using the `discard()` method. The `discard()` method takes one argument, which is the element you want to remove from the set. If the element is not in the set, the `discard()` method will not raise an exception. Here's an example:

```python
# Removing a specific element from a set using the 'discard()' method
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_set.discard(3)
print(my_set) # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

3. **Using the `pop()` Method:**
You can also remove an arbitrary element from a set using the `pop()` method. The `pop()` method removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set. If the set is empty, the `pop()` method will raise a `KeyError` exception. Here's an example:

```python
# Removing an arbitrary element from a set using the 'pop()' method
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
element = my_set.pop()
print(element) # Output: 1
print(my_set) # Output: {2, 3, 4, 5}
```

In this example, we remove an arbitrary element from the set `my_set` using the `pop()` method. The returned element is stored in the variable `element`, and the resulting set is printed. Note that since sets are unordered, the element that is popped from the set is arbitrary and may not be the first element in the set.

## Updating a Set

In Python, you can update a set with new elements using the `update()` method. The `update()` method takes one or more iterables as arguments, and adds all the elements from the iterables to the set. Here's an example:

```python
# Updating a set with new elements using the 'update()' method
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.update([3, 4, 5], {6, 7, 8})
print(my_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```

In this example, we update the set `my_set` with new elements using the `update()` method. We pass a list `[3, 4, 5]` and a set `{6, 7, 8}` as arguments to the `update()` method. All the elements from the iterables are added to the set `my_set`.

Note that when you update a set with new elements, duplicates are automatically removed. If you try to add an element that is already in the set, it will not be added again.

## Union of Sets

In Python, you can compute the union of two or more sets using the `union()` or `|` operator. The union of two sets is a new set that contains all the distinct elements from both sets. Here's an example:

```python
# Computing the union of two sets using the 'union()' method
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Computing the union of two sets using the '|' operator
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
union_set = set1 | set2
print(union_set) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

##  Intersection of Sets

In Python, you can compute the intersection of two or more sets using the `intersection()` or `&` operator. The intersection of two sets is a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets. Here's an example:

```python
# Computing the intersection of two sets using the 'intersection()' method
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection_set) # Output: {2, 3}

# Computing the intersection of two sets using the '&' operator
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
intersection_set = set1 & set2
print(intersection_set) # Output: {2, 3}
```

##  Difference of Sets

In Python, you can compute the difference of two sets using the `difference()` or `-` operator. The difference of two sets is a new set that contains only the elements that are in the first set and not in the second set. Here's an example:

```python
# Computing the difference of two sets using the 'difference()' method
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
print(difference_set) # Output: {1}

# Computing the difference of two sets using the '-' operator
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
difference_set = set1 - set2
print(difference_set) # Output: {1}
```

## Symmetric Difference of Sets

In Python, you can compute the symmetric difference of two sets using the `symmetric_difference()` or `^` operator. The symmetric difference of two sets is a new set that contains only the elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both. Here's an example:

```python
# Computing the symmetric difference of two sets using the 'symmetric_difference()' method
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
symmetric_difference_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
print(symmetric_difference_set) # Output: {1, 4}

# Computing the symmetric difference of two sets using the '^' operator
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {2, 3, 4}
symmetric_difference_set = set1 ^ set2
print(symmetric_difference_set) # Output: {1, 4}
```

# 4.5 Set Methods
---
Here are some additional set methods in Python:

- `clear()`: This method removes all the elements from the set.
  
  ```python
  set1 = {1, 2, 3}
  set1.clear()
  print(set1) # Output: set()
  ```

- `copy()`: This method returns a shallow copy of the set.
  
  ```python
  set1 = {1, 2, 3}
  set2 = set1.copy()
  print(set2) # Output: {1, 2, 3}
  ```

- `difference_update()`: This method removes all the elements from the set that are also in another specified set.
  
  ```python
  set1 = {1, 2, 3}
  set2 = {2, 3, 4}
  set1.difference_update(set2)
  print(set1) # Output: {1}
  ```

- `intersection_update()`: This method updates the set with the intersection of itself and another specified set.
  
  ```python
  set1 = {1, 2, 3}
  set2 = {2, 3, 4}
  set1.intersection_update(set2)
  print(set1) # Output: {2, 3}
  ```

- `isdisjoint()`: This method returns `True` if two sets have no common elements, otherwise returns `False`.
  
  ```python
  set1 = {1, 2, 3}
  set2 = {4, 5, 6}
  print(set1.isdisjoint(set2)) # Output: True
  
  set3 = {2, 3, 4}
  print(set1.isdisjoint(set3)) # Output: False
  ```

- `issubset()`: This method returns `True` if all the elements of a set are present in another specified set, otherwise returns `False`.
  
  ```python
  set1 = {1, 2, 3}
  set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  print(set1.issubset(set2)) # Output: True
  
  set3 = {2, 4, 6}
  print(set1.issubset(set3)) # Output: False
  ```

- `issuperset()`: This method returns `True` if a set contains all the elements of another specified set, otherwise returns `False`.
  
  ```python
  set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  set2 = {1, 2, 3}
  print(set1.issuperset(set2)) # Output: True
  
  set3 = {2, 4, 6}
  print(set1.issuperset(set3)) # Output: False
  ```

- `symmetric_difference_update()`: This method updates the set with the symmetric difference of itself and another specified set.
  
  ```python
  set1 = {1, 2, 3}
  set2 = {2, 3, 4}
  set1.symmetric_difference_update(set2)
  print(set1) # Output: {1, 4}
  ```

# 4.6 Frozen Sets
---
In Python, a `frozenset` is an immutable set. This means that once you create a `frozenset`, you cannot add or remove elements from it, or update it in any way. 

You can create a `frozenset` using the `frozenset()` function, which takes an iterable as its argument, just like the `set()` function. Here's an example:

```python
# Creating a frozenset
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
frozenset1 = frozenset(set1)
print(frozenset1) # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3})
```

Once you have created a `frozenset`, you can use it just like a regular set, but you cannot modify it in any way. For example, you can use `in` to check if an element is in a `frozenset`, or use methods like `intersection()` and `union()` to perform set operations on `frozenset`s. However, you cannot add or remove elements from a `frozenset`, or update it in any way. 

Here's an example that demonstrates this:

```python
# Using a frozenset
frozenset1 = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
print(2 in frozenset1) # Output: True
print(frozenset1.intersection({2, 3, 4})) # Output: frozenset({2, 3})
print(frozenset1.union({3, 4, 5})) # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})

# Trying to modify a frozenset (will result in an AttributeError)
frozenset1.add(4) # AttributeError: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
``` 

Note that `frozenset`s can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are immutable.

## Accessing Elements of Frozen Sets

Accessing elements of a `frozenset` works the same way as accessing elements of a regular `set`. Since a `frozenset` is an immutable object, you cannot change its elements or add new ones. However, you can use the `in` keyword to check whether an element is present in the `frozenset`.

Here's an example that shows how to access elements of a `frozenset`:

```python
# Creating a frozenset
f_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Accessing elements
print(1 in f_set) # Output: True
print(6 in f_set) # Output: False
```

In this example, we create a `frozenset` called `f_set` that contains the integers 1 through 5. We then use the `in` keyword to check whether the integers 1 and 6 are present in the `frozenset`. The first `print()` statement outputs `True`, because 1 is present in the `frozenset`. The second `print()` statement outputs `False`, because 6 is not present in the `frozenset`.

You can also iterate over the elements of a `frozenset` using a for loop, just like you would with a regular `set`:

```python
# Iterating over elements
for num in f_set:
    print(num)

# Output: 1
#         2
#         3
#         4
#         5
```

In this example, we use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the `frozenset` `f_set` and print each element to the console. The output shows that the loop iterates over each element of the `frozenset` in turn.

##  Modifying Frozen Sets

In Python, a `frozenset` is an immutable set, which means that it cannot be modified once it is created. You cannot add or remove elements from a `frozenset`, or update it in any way. Attempting to modify a `frozenset` will result in a `TypeError` because `frozenset` objects are immutable and do not support modifications.

Here's an example that demonstrates the immutability of `frozenset` objects:

```python
# Creating a frozenset
f_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Attempting to modify the frozenset (will result in a TypeError)
f_set.add(6)
```

In this example, we create a `frozenset` called `f_set` that contains the integers 1 through 5. We then attempt to add the integer 6 to the `frozenset` using the `add()` method. This will result in a `TypeError`, because `frozenset` objects are immutable and do not support modifications.

If you need to modify a set, you should use a regular `set` object instead of a `frozenset`. `set` objects are mutable and support adding and removing elements, as well as other set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

# 4.7 Set Comprehension
---
Set comprehension is a way to create a set by defining a set using a compact and easy-to-read syntax. It is similar to list comprehension and dictionary comprehension in Python.

The basic syntax for set comprehension is as follows:

```python
{expression for item in iterable}
```

This creates a new set that contains the values of the expression for each item in the iterable. Here's an example that demonstrates how set comprehension works:

```python
# Create a set of even numbers using set comprehension
even_numbers = {x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}

# Print the set
print(even_numbers)
```

In this example, we create a new set called `even_numbers` using set comprehension. The set contains all the even numbers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The `for` loop iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to 9, and the `if` statement filters out the odd numbers. The resulting set is `{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}`.

You can also use more complex expressions and conditions in set comprehension. Here's an example that demonstrates how to use set comprehension to create a set of the square roots of the even numbers between 0 and 9:

```python
# Create a set of square roots of even numbers using set comprehension
sqrt_even_numbers = {x ** 0.5 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}

# Print the set
print(sqrt_even_numbers)
```

In this example, we create a new set called `sqrt_even_numbers` using set comprehension. The set contains the square roots of all the even numbers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The `for` loop iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to 9, and the `if` statement filters out the odd numbers. The expression `x ** 0.5` calculates the square root of each even number. The resulting set is `{0.0, 1.4142135623730951, 1.7320508075688772, 2.0}`.
